Brief:
Directing the City Planning Commission to conduct a public hearing to consider amending
and re-ordaining the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. M.C.S. 4264, as
amended by Ordinance No. 26,413 M.C.S. and subsequent amendments) to expand
community solar opportunities with the following considerations:
i. Consider defining a ""Community Solar Project"" as ""a solar
energy system constructed and operated by a public or
private entity that connects directly to the electricity
distribution network and converts solar energy into
electricity and/or stores energy for the primary purpose
of serving electric demands offsite from the facility.
Community solar projects may allow multiple local
subscribers to purchase or lease ownership shares
or a percentage of the power produced on the site.""
ii. Consider creating accessory use standards for ""Community
Solar Projects,"" which may include minimum lot size
requirements, setbacks, design standards, and/or landscaping
requirements.
iii. Consider amending Article 21.6.J of the Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance to read as follows:
""1. A collective alternative energy system such as
a community solar project, wind energy system,
or geothermal energy system is permitted to be
constructed upon one or more properties owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners
association, institutional campus, religious institution,
non-profit organization, or a public entity. Collective
alternative energy systems shall be permitted as

amended by Ordinance No. 26,413 M.C.S. and subsequent amendments) to expand
community solar opportunities with the following considerations:
i. Consider defining a ""Community Solar Project"" as ""a solar
energy system constructed and operated by a public or
private entity that connects directly to the electricity
distribution network and converts solar energy into
electricity and/or stores energy for the primary purpose
of serving electric demands offsite from the facility.
Community solar projects may allow multiple local
subscribers to purchase or lease ownership shares

requirements, setbacks, design standards, and/or landscaping
requirements.
iii. Consider amending Article 21.6.J of the Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance to read as follows:
""1. A collective alternative energy system such as
a community solar project, wind energy system,
or geothermal energy system is permitted to be
constructed upon one or more properties owned
