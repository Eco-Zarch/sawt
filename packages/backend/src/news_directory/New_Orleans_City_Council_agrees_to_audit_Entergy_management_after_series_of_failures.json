Those power cuts included a major Sewerage & Water Board drinking water facility as well as more than 25,000 of the city's residential and business customers.\nIn addition to the investigation by the City Council, which regulates Entergy New Orleans, the state Public Service Commission also is investigating Entergy Louisiana over winter billing.\nThe regulators set the overall level Entergy can charge ratepayers by capping its \"return on equity\" in each jurisdiction. They also can and frequently do investigate specific charges and require the utility to rebate customers if they're found to have overcharged or delivered poor service. However, a full management audit is rare.\nThe rolling black outs in February had been needed as part of much broader cuts required by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, known as MISO, as the unprecedented cold snap strained the regional system close to its breaking point.\nEntergy is one of more than 50 transmission operators across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba, who buy, sell and exchange power as part of the MISO grid. The freeze had overloaded the entire southern part of that system.\nThe strain was nowhere near as bad as that seen in Texas, where the system nearly collapsed and prolonged blackouts led to extreme hardship and dozens of deaths.\nHowever, the rolling outages implemented by Entergy were supposed to be spread between all of its regional customers and New Orleans ended up taking about 50% of those allocated to the whole of Louisiana, when it accounts for only about 15% of the state's customers.\n+5\nEntergy said it cut 3 times more power to New Orleans than needed during blackouts. It was more.\nWhen Entergy New Orleans executives admitted to the City Council two weeks ago that it had shut off three times as much power as needed during\u2026\nThe council committee heard Tuesday from Entergy's director of system planning and operations, Mike Goin, and the head of distribution, Eli Viamontes, that New Orleans took an outsized share of the power cuts largely because Entergy hadn't checked its computer inputs to make sure the sequence of \"feeders\" were cut in a manner that spread the burden.\nDavid Ellis, Entergy New Orleans CEO, said the utility had not had to implement rolling cuts for two decades and had to respond to events quickly.\n\"This event was very fast and it occurred right after there was a public appeal\" for customers to cut back on usage, he said.\nBut Moreno said after the presentations by Entergy executives that it was clear the company hadn't tested its systems appropriately.\n\"I hate to say it but it just was a complete failure on y\u2019all\u2019s part,\" she said. \"Ratepayers were left in the cold and the dark by mistakes that you made.\"\nEntergy also took the heat from council members for failing to communicate in a timely manner. The council heard that Entergy had not put out a press release about the Mardi Gras cuts until four minutes before the cuts came to an end, which was well after many restaurants and other city businesses already had to shut down for the night.\n+4\nEntergy should pay $1B in refunds, damages to customers over faulty power plant, regulators say\nEntergy Corp. wrongfully charged customers over eight years for a nuclear power station that often malfunctioned and was repeatedly deemed uns\u2026\nEntergy also was quizzed about why the outage map appeared to show that cuts were concentrated in the city's less advantaged neighborhoods, such as parts of Central City and New Orleans East.\nEllis said he was personally offended by the suggestion, made in comments submitted by Monique Harden, a director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, that neighborhoods had been selected for power cuts based on socio-economic factors, noting that he and his family were products of such neighborhoods.\nHarden responded: \"Instead of getting angry with me, he should work on improving Entergy's service and commit to ensuring equity,\" noting that a \"computer glitch\" wasn't a sufficient explanation for how the priority list for cuts last month had been determined in the first place.\nJohn Hawkins, another Entergy distribution manager, told the council committee that those who were at the top of the list for cuts last month would now move to the bottom of the list for future cuts.\nCity Council launches investigation into Entergy's handling of winter storm, rolling blackouts\nThe New Orleans City Council voted at its meeting Thursday to begin a forensic investigation into Entergy New Orleans and its handling of last\u2026\nThe group of activists that called for the management audit in Monday's letter included: 350 New Orleans, A Community Voice, Audubon Louisiana, Coalition Against Death Alley, Climate Reality Project, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, Greater New Orleans Interfaith Climate Coalition, Louisiana League of Conscious Voters, Sierra Club, Sustainable Energy Economy Solutions, and VAYLA- New Orleans.\nThe letter said the audit should range widely, looking at reasons for the \"sky high\" bills customers have been receiving in recent months, the lack of transparency about how charges are determined, top level compensation at the utility, as well as measures Entergy New Orleans is taking to address climate change.\n\"We cannot afford nor do we seek yet another special meeting that involves a presentation by Entergy in lieu of concrete regulatory action,\" the activists wrote on Monday.\nEntergy reports record profit of nearly $1.4 billion even as demand was hit by pandemic\nEntergy Corp. reported a record profit of nearly $1.4 billion last year, up 11% from 2019, despite lower sales across the board as demand for \u2026\nThe activists pointed to an audit ordered in late 2019 by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission of Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) and its subsidiaries.\nThe five-month audit by independent energy consultant Munro Tulloch resulted in $21 million of immediate cost savings and identified a further $26 million that could be made within a year and passed through to ratepayers. It also found lax oversight by management and underinvestment in key infrastructure.\nAt Tuesday's council committee meeting, Entergy lawyer Alyssa Maurice-Anderson said that Entergy customers could expect lower bills in April, despite a rise in fuel costs. A decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that Entergy should return some deferred tax payments to ratepayers would offset the higher natural gas prices, she said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nMORE INFORMATION\nWhat caused 8,500 customers in New Orleans to lose power?
