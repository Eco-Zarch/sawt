"page_content=""I meet these goals I get there and for a lot of people that's what keeps them in the military because they have a goal I think that when you don't have a clear promotional process and especially when you look at our structure there's a fixed number of positions at all ranks and so not only do you have to work towards being a lieutenant or a captain there are only certain instances in which that rank becomes available so the window of opportunity is even smaller so when you see that massive dissatisfaction with who you know clicks and cronyism it's even more devastating because you might be on the force for 10 years and only two Captain spots come up so if you don't ever if you don't believe from Jump Street you've got a clear chance to get there and there's only a chance to will come up than it really is demoralizing because it's not like the department is is growing at such a space and with the constrained Civil Service puts on it I mean beyond the rank of Sergeant the opportunities"" metadata={'source': 'fxbVwYjIaok'}"
