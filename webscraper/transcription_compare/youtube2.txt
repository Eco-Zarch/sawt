stand right here in the front and take a photo for our social media post Council Members Juso and Morel will join I’ll be what good two w how are you doing just stand back I am you want to come forward come on yeah yeah come on come on come on these are your friends good sit under here yeah right this is not a seat I like to sit not y’all want to talk about that though well look I obviously by the banner before I even sat down it goes to show what high regard we hold you in I’m you know a lot of times when we’re here you kind of get in the mood of what you want to say but I was actually thinking more about you and I think Council Member Morel in particular can respond to this it’s really tough when you are sometimes related to a parent who has in your case a huge if not iconic legacy in the city and then I think on top of that sometimes people want to attribute that to your parent what you have and not necessarily to your own talent and your own hard work and I don’t want anybody to take away or diminish from any of your own accomplishments of what you’ve done in running your company and getting this incredible SBA award where you’ve told me that they may be following you around and making sure that you get the recognition and really the public notoriety that you so richly deserve and I guess sort of just enclosing you know the banner we did and giving you a hard time is because we love you and you know you don’t see us do these things when we’re frustrated or we don’t have a relationship with somebody but I think all these people up here I know all these people up here have a relationship respect you love you and want nothing but success for you I appreciate it the feel absolutely the same and I’m going to turn it over to my colleagues hey good morning my friend good to see you well of course congratulations you know we saw it all over social media and really promoted everywhere your success and recognition but at the same time I think that you’re up for like a national award too is that correct yeah I’m in the running and there’s only 49 other people I have to compete with only 49 but still out of the country like that’s actually not that many is there anything we can do to help you maybe amplify you what we can do to get you to be number one I don’t know I feel like this is amazing I’m so honored to be sitting on this side of this table for a good reason I don’t know anything that you can do outside of what you’re doing right now and just being able to be recognized by my home city you know it’s Louisiana right I don’t always feel like I’m a welcome part of the state all the time but in New Orleans and in this city I always feel welcome it always feels like home yeah and I thank y’all I thank y’all for everything y’all do and y’all are part of the reasons why I feel like that well I’ll say this I mean obviously we’re proud of this recognition that you’re getting but I’m mostly proud of you of the person who you are and the leadership and the type of role model who you are for particularly other women in this city you are in a male dominated field and you are obviously as we’re recognizing you today succeeding you know leaps and bounds above many others our pledge will be led by council member King flag United

turn over the floor to Mr Larry barabino to introd introduce those who are at the table today and thank you Larry for the work that you and N do that helps to organize coaches not only in District D

this is Mr Larry barabino the executive director of New Orleans Recreation development commission thank you good good morning everyone good morning council members uh first of all councilman green thank you for asking us to assemble to recognize the coaches of District d as he's indicated there's about 120 plus coaches through n that's registered in District D however we have close to five 00 coaches Citywide right this is only representing District D and you know we at Nord are grateful for our volunteer coaches because you know ND is built on the backs of volunteers it is the efforts it is the support it is the commitments of the volunteer coaches Citywide that make sure that ND have productive and safe places for our kids uh to be because of course you guys know my budget couldn't hold employing over close to 500 volunteers that are here but nationally though the most successful parks and wreck agencies are built on the backs of those volunteers with their Sweat Equity with their time with their efforts energy and also their personal contributions to the kids in cities to the kids throughout the cities but specifically to the kids of the City of New Orleans um and so we have assembled here today just some of the coaches that are here um that represents um coaching in District D and I'll be remiss one of our coaches couldn't be here but I definitely wanted to make sure of all our coaches here that I acknowledge coach Ernest GS who have dedicated over 30 years as a volunteer coach with the with n but also with that Ernest gathers and Ernest gathers is a coach um that he's a former city employee that dedicated 30 years working for the City of New Orleans um and he couldn't be here but you know he's one of those guys who today these younger coaches stand on his shoulders you know the younger coaches that are came behind him at wiie Hall playground standing on his shoulders but today you know we have with us representation from different parks and playgrounds and I want to again thank them for all that they do um there's nothing perfect right but we know that we work through every challenge that we get at ND to ensure that all of our kids in the city have the opportunity and these coaches are the reason that you see not only with the sports side of it but we have volunteers on the cultural side as as well as our outdoor side of it so we want to acknowledge all those volunteers and I will yield to allow I know councilman you guys have it set up for each of the different individuals at the tables to say a few words so I will yield for that to take place uh good morning how you guys doing uh Brian Randol representation of willly Hall playground uh uh first off I want to thank you guys for uh allowing us uh this chance and be recognized and also understand the work we do do but we also understand the work you guys do uh thank you for the work you do uh running the city helping our city grow each and every day uh I don't know how many people tell you thank you but genuinely thank you to everybody in all the districts that help us get to where we need to get at and we appreciate this opportunity from willly Hall playground thank you uh pass it on to my guy Shaq we and the coach Shaq Brown uh Lemma playground I'm here because what I saw was I graduated uh this year be 30 years and I graduated May 31st 1995 and June by June 5th I was at the community center telling them that I wanted to help kids and I didn't want anything from it next year will be 30 years that and I'm still saying the same thing what we what we see here is what we have to embrace with our children not all of them are coming from uh good backgrounds but most importantly they trust in us they want us to push what it is that they believe in and a lot of times we tend to turn around what they want so what show y’all today is really quick is I have a shirt on that says it’s okay to be a nerd that’s the shirt that I have on and it comes from my 10 year-old son he was being bullied he was being called a nerd and talk about his glasses so what I did is I took a picture of him and I said we going to embrace that we going to embrace who you are today in a world that’s filled with violence and guns and everybody promoting the wrong thing I told him we were going to embrace that and what I did is I brought shirts for all the council members today so y’all going to have a shirt before y’all leave [Applause] my name my name is Larry Cook I’ve been a St for playing bunny FR in in 1966 was one of the first African men to play at bunny FR and the first thing I want to talk about is my coach the main thing that we was here for I had a coach name is U is darling shaww she uh when I was out sick didn’t know I was going to make it back so she was the baby one that took over the park and made sure that it ran correctly and with most of the neighbors that was in the in the neighborhood they they took on and when I came back and she continued to work with me and another person I want to give out is called Eric Castle Eric Castle is a person that we built the baseball field in new uh bny friend he is the keeper he’s the ones that keep up the park every day he comes out every day to help me keep up the park next thing I wanted to talk about is it’s not uh it’s not negative it’s it’s a rule change a rule change that when the founders uh founded no cuz at one time n was the best in the country I don’t know if everybody knew that but one thing that one rules that when they they came out and they figured out how to balance each Park throughout the country and what they did was they made rules when they made rules to enforce it what they did was they made every kid in the community Play Because when they changed rules it was it was a little racial cuz what happened was that uh they black played black and white played black but that’s but after they still balanced it out cuz I was there in 1966 and and at the time when I was there like I said I was one of the first African-American players at bunny FR and I think that we need to look at that rule one thing that I I would love to happen at at a city council can do is that City C can form a a a committee what the committee does they will come out and they was they would go out and come to the games and what they would do is they would respect what that what we doing and one things that couple of things that I think is very I know is very very important like I said I’ve been around this program uh over 30 something years I coach for 20 I was a volunteer coach for 27 years I know how important volunteer coaches are then what happened I was a full years as a acting supervisor and I’ve been a supervisor for 15 years so I know about this this uh cuz ien seen this this Recreation change and one reason how I found out that it was number one that we played for I played for a team called the New Orleans Vikings it was a team that we we did we played teams from all over the country then we played we played uh we went to play Philadelphia and when I went to went to play Philadelphia what happened was that we before we went to the game the guy sat down and told me that that that we was one of the best in the country and I said Thank you peace everybody um today I’d like to give thanks to the City of New Orleans ND and city council for having us um I truly appreciate being recognized as this is the first time anyone from our specific Community has been in this position I’m honored to be representing for one very unique part of New Orleans culture which is the skateboard culture um our persistance in staying active and collectively uplifting the seven World area has been noticed and we appreciate that I'd like to thank the entire skate Community specifically Humidity Skate Shop Johnny Beasley Brandon of aircraft clothing and Brent of therapy skate shops as well as kasta Nola and the consistent Hands-On people providing resources in that space whether they became for before me or after me this is a win for all of us we are hoping because of meetings like this we have political and financial backing from the city and the state to show support that ND has for us for program directors such as myself hopefully this meeting creates the relationships necessary for us to to be able to solidify simple things like water fountains restroom facilities working electricity storage containers helmets and padding um security guards to be secured specifically but not to be policed these are just some of the short-term goals we are aiming for um in support of everything that you are doing we appreciate you from the skate Community thank you good afternoon everyone my name is Nick Thomas I'm a representative of Samson playground in uh the night Water Area uh and it is truly an honor to be here and to be able to receive recognition from uh all of you uh my ask is that you continue to work with no and Mr Larry to allow us to continue to change lives um because when we are able to do that whether you all know it or not you are also change in lives uh so we do have a need at Sams but again we’ve had conversation with Mr Larry and we know that it is important to him to allow us to continue to move forward um I do have a message it will be very quick that I would like to share there’s a kid that I coach his name was Devon I met Devon when he was 7 years old at Samson playground and now he is a freshman at Talladega College here’s a text message I got from him on just yesterday what’s up Dad I want to give you a quick update on how college life has been this semester has been very cool I’m trying to be consistent in everything that I do school has been great and the band has been even better I do apologize for not reaching out to as much as I could but it’s been tough reaching out to even my mom Devon’s dad is not in his life I stepped up being Devon’s coach he said but I’m just having so much fun up here I try the time is flying by I pray and hope everything is going well for you I love you and would always be grateful for the things that you did for me I’m going to start making sure I’m more active so you don’t get upset this is what you this is what you allow us to do as coaches when you work with leaders like Larry and I ask that you continue to do that because you are changing lives whether you realize it or not thank you thank you coach good morning my name is Dwayne Vette and I’m representing PCH Train park playground first of all I’d like to say once again good morning councel and congratulations former police chief wood on your years of service I’d like to thank councilman green for this opportunity and Jordan harer for the vision to recognize our deckplate leaders the Nord coaches as a part of that recognition I’d like to recognize my fellow coaches and family at P Train park if you’re here would you please stand [Applause] when we the coaches think of Nord we focus on the sports programs however there’s a lot more to Nord than Sports and I’d like to thank Larry barbino for his efforts in all of Nord and the things that he does outside of our Recreational Sports coaching is an exhausting mentoring effort we donate our time money and love to the children of of New Orleans it is sometimes a dangerous effort we often encounter bigger and parents young adults with guns and the like we often ask one another what can we do to make our parts safer more policing better security but that’s a battle all of New Orleans fights and we understand that everyone is under man and underst staffed we understand staffing is loyal times and it's often hard to get things accomplished but provided with the necessary tools and equipment the parks can begin to invest in themselves if the initial investment in fixing the fields was given we the park and the park boosters can maintain those initial investments and take pride in where we played I want to thank Larry Barbino for helping us to establish a booster club at Pontrain Park which has brought in more funds we can do more things around our park also like to thank Councilman Green, Councilwoman Moreno for attending our banquet and showing an interest in our park I look forward to seeing more of you at the parks take pride in what you offer to us to give to the children it'd be great to see some of you at the parks and seeing what we're doing and seeing the condition of the parks and where you can assist thank you for your time and recognition thank you very much can we all give a nice round of applause to all of our coaches those who are watching [Applause] thank you councilman, councilman Green and council members I'll be remiss if I don't acknowledge the women that coach at NORD because you're seeing these men at the panel but the girls side of NORD whether you have the volleyball side, the softball side, even have girls that's participating in flag football we even have in our basketball side, track and field side, you know we have our female coaches that coach we have our U moms that come out and coach we've even have, and I'm very excited to announce with the support of all the coaches citywide NORD put together a 14-year-old citywide Biddy Basketball team that won the Biddy National Championship this last weekend they won the Biddy National Championship and I would love to bring those that team to the council to be recognized as well okay thank you very much thank you very much I'm going to ask Jordan for a couple of comments Mr. Jordan Har Baker who is my District D liaison Community liaison one of four that I have and then if any council members want to close us out before we take a photo this would be an opportunity Mr. Jordan Har Baker yes thanks everybody, my name is Jordan Michael Har Baker in my professional capacity I'm the liaison to the upper 9th ward, in my personal life I'm a coach I've coached basketball, football, baseball with some of the gentlemen up here and around I have had the honor of learning from and working alongside Legends honestly living legends in history, just want to just give a big thank you to creating the space for letting this happen from what I understand, it's the first time something like this has happened and it's time that we see the visible faces that they, we see, they're seen and are heard, I just want to give a big thank you to all the coaches that are here to Digby, Harden, Lan, McHugh, Pontrain Park, Stallings, St. Rock, Bunny Friend, who else am I missing, Wiie Hall and Odell Davis playground. I have seen over the past year the coaches go out of their pocket, go out of their time, go out of their resources I've seen them picking up kids and providing transportation to and from games and practices, I have seen the coaches be family members, be mentors, be teachers, I mean it's not just coaching, it's off the field too, the coaches are checking in on the families, checking in on the kids, these coaches before us, the coaches that are behind us, 120 that are here, the 500 throughout NORD, they keep our Parks. running to keep our kids safe and they're not asking for anything besides just a little help every once in a while um I say that just say thank you coaches all the coaches that are here today thank you for coming all the coaches that are watching I know yall are work because I've seen you come to the practice we your work Uniforms on um and thank you to all the kids that show up every single day this is huge this is my Monumental and uh just again thank you
thank you Mr Jordan harer organized the coaches today and I want to thank [Applause] him and if you don't mind we'll close out with brief comments from our council members and then we'll come forward for a a photo councilman juso well good morning I don't know that I need the shirt to say that I'm a nerd but I'm more than happy to take it um I I just want to say two things one is how appreciative we are of the time that you give um you know this city can sometimes be tough but we love it and the most precious commodity we have is our time and the fact that you are willing to give your time the one thing that you can never get back to help kids is so incredibly important and then you know as you as you get older now as I'm watching my kids get older you realize that you do not achieve unless somebody puts their arm around you and helps you and sometimes that's not always your mom your dad your aunt your grandparents it's your coach and my kids are swimmers and we stay away from all the stuff because their coach coaches them up hard and that's their job it's not my job to get in the middle of that and we appreciate the fact that you teach them these very hard lessons about you're not always going to win how do you lose with Grace how you win as a team together how you succeed together how you overcome how much hard work really pays off um and so we appreciate everything that you do and all the parks that Jordan named and all of your hard work thank you all so much yes sir council member Harris I I really couldn't have said it better um I appreciate everything that you do on a daily basis um and I know how critical It is for young people to have access to mentorships to to adults who really care about them um Larry thank you for your um commitment to ensuring that our parks are up to speed and when they're not communicating with us to get them into the shape that they need to be I pass Al Davis every day I see kids playing on it there's some improvements that I'd love to make and I know that we're working on that together so um that's extremely important important to my community as far as being a nerd I can count probably at least three of us up here so I'm really excited about the shirt that we're about to receive so thank you all council member King thank you coaches thank you Council MC green for for putting this together and uh thank thanks to all the coaches here and and the ones throughout the city U that's what makes that's what make Nord what it is to volunteer coaches because like coach barbino said you can't pay all the coaches and you all do a job um that really you can't put a value on because you save lives every day and you make lifetime relationships and you you Mentor people are young men and women throughout their lives up until their adult ages so again thank you uh for all that you do and again coach um again council member green thank you for the recognition this much deserved recognition thank you council member King Council president Moreno thank you thank you council member uh green for bringing the coaches before us it's really great to see all of you all here but more importantly thank you so much for the tremendous uh volunteer work that you do uh with the children of New Orleans I remember uh thinking back of how much my coaches meant to me playing sports and how much they help mold me you are helping to mold the children of New Orleans into being prosperous adults and we we certainly appreciate you for for doing that and as far as you know of course it's okay to be a nerd man don't I know it when I was a kid not only did I have glasses but I was the girl in headgear walking around okay so yes it's okay to be a nerd and I can't waar wait to to wear your your shirt and to um Jordan thank you for your heartfelt comment um you work really hard at City Hall but you also work really hard in the community volunteering your time and I just wanted to say how much we appreciate you as well so thank you all for being here thank you Council vice president Morel uh once again like my colleague said I thank Council M green and Jordan for bringing everyone here today we really appreciate all of your hard work in the community and to be being present Jordan in the community and being available um I'd also like to thank Larry of course for all the work he's done I think it's really important to highlight how tirelessly and hard Larry works for Nord and I say that because during our budget process when we get the budget every Department says I need this amount of money and usually they come here and say well that money's adequate I'll take it Larry was like I need more money and Larry came to this Council and said if you give me more money I can provide more programming and do more work to reach kids and he has been very aggressive in a good way very very aggressive saying if you provide our coaches you provide our facilities with the resources we will reach these kids and we will help these kids and we will change lives and this Council has been very very intentional both with increasing nord's budget working I know you worked with council member Moreno with the Council on Rec fund to get more money for uniforms and equipment we are going to continue to scour every couch between a cushions everywhere we can go to find more and more resources for Nord because when you look at the most successful aspects of lowering crime and bad outcomes in the city you can track in our history when Nord is properly funded when Nord is properly funded and resourced we do better as a community because our kids need to be engaged where they're at they need to have Role Models people like yourselves who are reaching out to them and show showing that someone cares and on a real basic level if as a city we cannot show that kids are a priority they internalize that if we can't show that they are the priority and resourcing them is a priority whether it be when we pay them their checks in the summer for their work or whether it be when they're at those at those games with y'all with uniforms and equipment that isn't threadbear and used it's on us and hold us to account to make sure we're giving you what you need cuz your job you're already doing your job you're showing up our job is to make sure you have what you need to be successful and Larry has been a tremendous Advocate saying they need more and we will always strive to give you more thank you thank you Council vice president council member Thomas well first of all I want to thank uh Jordan for helping organize this thank you council member green but uh thank to men and women who ER and who coach at Nord of course Larry knows my life wouldn't be what it is right now if it wasn't for coaches at Nord uh Sam and Cooney came to bunny FR and they volunteered there were College athletes who volunteered uh coach Sims coach Eugene coach mcklin coach D'Angelo at stallins my dad and Coach Paul if if it wasn't for those folk taking out of their time but somebody said something earlier and uh uh Larry and and and and Brian know for the people who are here as a former Nord athlete and as a former College athlete one of the most important things kids can see is see you there I don't just go to the games to watch coach bam and watch my son or my nephews or those kids I'm at the game because I enjoy it but also so that they'll know that their people they see on television are notable people are from the community sitting through those games to watch coach Tiggy and the allstar team practice and to watch them fumble through learning to play basketball at Stalin Center when they look in the stands and they see people who the world says it's notable it tells them that they matter uh Brian doesn't talk about the high school games and what what happens at the high school games and talking to the kids before the game but just sitting there and then Shaq you've dedicated your life and for the other coaches here coach Larry uh we can't pay you enough uh for what you've done uh when you integrated bunny friend playground I came there and my brother came a few years later if it wasn't for you integrating that park there wouldn't have been a spot for us at that part and for that Allstar team we played on you were really humble we beat uh the mhler allstar team if everyone's heard of Moher High School the famous Ohio football where we defeat a program uh we beat them uh we beat that team from Austin Texas uh we beat that team in Philadelphia and when you talk about resources we didn't have enough money we had raise enough money to travel uh we have raised enough money for PM lar but remember we had to stay with the families of the teams that we were competing against we didn't have enough money for hotels my parents surely did where we come from we didn't and that experience for me just to be able to go there it was the first time I'd ever stayed in a home where everybody had their own room and I'll never forget that white Philadelphia family touring me through the house and asking me which which room would I like where we grew up it was a bedroom that was your parents' bedroom everybody else found a place to stay but what it did for me it motivated me through being able to go there and experience that to say oh wow we could we should have a home with our own rooms too this is something I wanted to shoot for and and Larry you were humble in that folk don't know in your class you were one of the fastest kids in the country and that Alla team that we played on they took the very best and you were one of the best not just as an athlete but as a human being and lastly from my family to yours my mom mom's not here anymore dad's not here but thank you uh for naming that bowl game uh after my father that was one of the highlights of his life and thank you for G for giving him that before he passed we love you man thank you thank you very much members of the council my fellow members we have proclamations for each of the 120 coaches and I want to thank Jordan har Baker for helping that with that and Pierce Huff but also the members of our city council in their office for their ations in signing 120 documents those documents read as you know as regular Proclamation from the city but thank you for your dedication and service to the Youth

and we bid farewell to Michelle wood for thank you thank you thank thank you da Williams thank you uh Mr MC and I I don't know the 3bs uh but I'll try not to be as long-winded as I used to be when I was on the Das uh and I don't have that uh Paul Robinson baritone voice that Mr Robinson has it's for rent it's for rent I have to rent it uh Norman described uh the the the history and the tenure uh of Michelle but I want to talk about the the woman and the human being you know we get we get these we get these important jobs uh and and and a lot is asked of you when you decide to serve but a lot of times people forget when you get these jobs that you are the same human being the same man the same woman that you were the day before and whether it's the 40 years before you took an oath to serve uh and a lot will be said a lot has been said about the professional that Michelle woodfork is but want to talk about the woman uh behind the badge the daughter behind the badge the sister and friend behind the badge and most importantly the mother behind the badge um she has an amazing son uh and uh that is the most important job a human being can have taking care and of and raising another human being and it is not easy to raise a young black man uh in a city uh that is known for violent crime um because no matter how beautiful your kid is no matter how good their grades are uh when some folks see a tall strapping good-looking Brown uh 16y old or 17y old walking down the street they don't see a beautiful son they see Public Enemy Number One right and it's her job to protect and serve and police this community and she did not not Lobby for this job she didn't apply for this job she when she got it she was working dutifully as she always did and she simply accepted the call and she she accepted the call at not a great time to be a police officer in the wake of George Floyd and Banna Taylor when a lot of people uh want want to want to defund the police and abolish prisons and and don't want to be involved in the system she took the job she took the job when uh New Orleans had the title as the murder capital of the world she stepped up uh and a number of people would not have done that uh that there was a great deal of uncertainty in that uh with her son in high school getting ready for college uh when our children need us most she figured out a way to do it all uh when I say do it all she was able to make sure that her son stayed task and she also was an amazing partner in executing on and developing strategies that took New Orleans from being the murder capit of the world to not being the murder cap of the world but not just in homicides she was instrumental in crafting executing strategies that brought down crime in every major category more so than any other city in this country uh and this community owes her a huge uh debt uh and a huge amount of gratitude uh for that um no one else has done that in this country um and she did it um you know really the moment's notice uh that first Saturday after you got sworn in you were at my house for about 3 hours working on strategy working on Basics working on police report writing um working on prioritizing the crimes that matter most to community um you know I I think that um certain folks get the blame when crime goes up but those same folks don't get credit when crime goes down whatever reason I don't know I ask the media on the way out why it works that way good luck Michelle deserves credit for the position that New Orleans uh found itself in uh at the top of this year uh the rest of the country is recognizing it so I'm glad that uh the City of New Orleans is recognizing it so we all you uh I um I am so grateful that I got to work with you and I got to serve with you and so GL so glad that we got to partner to strategize to serve the people of this community to bring Crime down in every category um and I'm also very excited uh for what uh is going to come next in your life um uh and I'm just reminded that Michael Jordan also retired uh but he got back in the game Lieutenant Lieutenant Richardson yes sir good morning everyone morning it is my absolute pleasure and honor to have been chosen to share a fewers with you this morning about my best friend who happens to be the former interim superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department Michelle woodf I have had the honor of working with Michelle my entire 25y year career and oh what a ride it has been I've witnessed Michelle worked tirelessly for the City of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department a task that she gracefully and professionally took on for 33 years I remember when we first crossed paths over two decades ago and in my younger days I was quite the rambunctious person quite a handful yeah however there was an immediate connection with Michelle and I I of course being the rang buch's little sister and Michelle being the experienced big sister Michelle took me under her Wing she gave me Grace as I learned how to navigate through the ranks of the New Orleans Police Department she always made sure I was good she had the patience of Job when it came to showing me the ropes of how to do things I mean hey like I did say I could be a handful at times Michelle is one of the most dedicated and hardworking people I know she was always present for the team and often put the mission first it takes a special type of person to take on different roles and quite frankly some cannot handle not being the one or watching someone else take the lead but not Michelle you see during the course of our careers and our friendship Michelle has been both a supporter and a leader a mentor and a mentee my cheerleader and often times the first person to pull my coattails each time one of us was promoted the other was front and center you see I believe that people come into your life for reasons and Seasons you have blessings and lessons I can go on and on about the many reasons lessons and blessings that I have led to me that have led to me to holding Michelle woodfork so dearly but I do believe I'm on a time limit today so I'll carry on Michelle and I have always celebrated together we've cried together most importantly though Michelle and I always always prayed together as I stated earlier Michelle and I weren't just colleagues we are best friends we are also Sorority Sisters of the first and the finest alha Kappa Alpha Sor he Incorporated I had to add that in yes I did we are a part of each other's Village because you see it's one thing to be a police officer on a daily basis








it's a totally different thing to be a female police officer on a daily basis let alone a high ranking
successful one you see as female officers we don't only carry the burden of protecting the City of New Orleans and her citizens and her many many visitors but we also carry the burden and the responsibility of taking care of our homes our children and our families think about it when something goes wrong no matter how old you are the first person you're going to call is probably your mom Michelle and I not only supported each other on the job but we supported each other in our most important roles the roles of motherhood and if you think she was an amazing superintendent you should have witnessed her when she's in her role as Nick's mom Rochelle's sister or as a loving daughter Michelle you are an amazing human being I am so grateful to have experienced life with you my career with you and all of Shenanigans alongside you I so PR proud of you friend and I cannot wait to see what this next chapter holds I love you Chief Kirk Pat Chief Kirk Patrick city council thank you so much for honoring Chief wood Fork I am grateful for you for doing so you know if it hadn't been for chief Wood Park I would not be here today because she open the door she will always be the person who is the first woman and the first

believe and I know we all believe and he's very proud of the work that you've done in this very very important police department and this very very worthy City a council member talked about the fact that sometimes when crime is going down you don't get the recognition that you need but oh if it's going up then it's all about the police and what the police aren't doing what responses they aren't making what kind of things aren't being done that should be done but let me make it clear that this is an incredible period in our city with violent crime going down as it's going down in our city double digits over 20% in the four major categories um that makes our citizens safer and it also says something good about the City of New Orleans that we don't have to accept some of the negativity of the past that we are a city that can improve greatly and can move forward I'm just so very proud of the fact that you over 33 years have shown the professionalism that has encouraged others to recognize the value of being a member of the New Orleans Police Department certainly as was mentioned you're working recruiting civilians to assist in our police but just the fact also that you are everywhere everywhere that people asked you to be you went and you had a positive disposition about you that made a difference that makes a difference in our city today so there are so many ways that we need to say thank you but the most important thing that we can do is to use the words here today thank you very much for your service you have helped make the City of New Orleans a better place to live you have helped to develop a better future for our city of New Orleans I'm proud of the New Orleans Police Department one of the reasons that I'm proud is because of officers like you leaders like you the chief like you who have served with capacity and also served with constitutional policing and also Outreach to our community that makes a difference so thank you for the work that you do and I am so pleased that you were sitting right next to our new superintendent and that you offered your services your valuable Services during this transition and make it so easy you all help to let people know that we have a team and we have a family within our New Orleans Police Department thank you for the work that you've done and I look forward to celebrating with you as you continue to do great work thank you P remember morale thank you apologize for my
tardiness I've known Michelle for a very very long time you do my family for a very long long time you're a daughter of the city you have done so much and accomplished so much
for the city and you've given so much to this city and I don't feel like as a council as a city will ever be able to fully adequately Express how much you've done for the City of New Orleans in your time here and the things you're going to continue to do but all of the accolades you've received today are truly heartfelt and when I talk to the men and women of the nopd just as a police officers you know the hardest people to please are your colleagues and the amount of stuff y'all give each other is truly epic y'all don't see the way councils I mean the way officers burn each other on a daily basis it is it's epic and the amount of accolades they give you privately for the work you've done over the years and the work you've done to help them both personally and professionally we just can't Encompass it so I certainly am grateful we as a city as a council are grateful of everything you've done we look forward to what you will do but know that whatever Kudos we give you it'll never be enough thank you thank you thank you thank you I want to thank all of my colleagues and I want to thank everyone who who came here today uh to support this great human being you know uh it's easy to uh support titles uh celebrities it's uh always easy to acknowledge notables on their way out it's always easy to talk about emotional relationships political relationships uh familiar relationships but when people asked me about my my why my support was unwavering it really wasn't about that I like good people who are smart so when we had conversations about Dr weburg and concentration policing I could talk to you about that when we had conversations about impact budgeting and deployment I could talk to you about that when we had conversations about policing strategies right and highlighting hotspots going after those people who have earned the right to be off the street when we talked about the Peter sharp model yeah uh I could talk to you about that I could talk to you about the Dr peny from suo model about prevention yes we want to lock people up but we want to be in an environment where law enforcement knows they got to support those social science issues about how you create an environment Mr da where you don't have to lock people up so all
those niceties are nice but it was sure nice to be able to talk to somebody who was intellectual enough and scientific enough and smart enough that I could go from budgeting to good field and emotions and I don't think you get enough credit for that yes you were the first black woman yes you were the first female but you were one of the few people who understood scientific policing scientific constitutional policing and then the last thing is I mean if when you look at the definition you see your family here right next to woodf Fork is community service woodf equals community service whether it's your uncle your mom your dad your sister your family and what some folk don't know during a height of what what you setting a standard here so that Chief Kirk Patrick could build on they don't know what you were dealing with with your son and your father and your family never wavered never stopped doing your job yeah I like all of the Kudo stuff boy but I sure like people who smart enough and tough enough to do their job that's Michelle that's
superintendent that's Michelle woodf for to me God bless you we appreciate everything you've done and thank you for setting a standard where we can't go backwards the only thing we can do is build on and go forward thank you now it's your turn superintendent thank you first of all I want to thank God because without um my faith I would be nothing and definitely without my family um I would be nothing my mother and father um two great people with two total opposites my mother is definitely the nurturer and my dad is definitely the driving force which uh helped create who I am today and so I have to say um uh thank you to them and I love them and of course my sister who is like my second mother she would she she pushed and pushed um and so and I love her for that and then of course my son um who is my everything who um is the most important person to me um who makes me smile who warms my heart who gives purpose to everything that I do and especially to serve um I wanted him to um grow into a man of God and which he's doing I wanted him to be successful at anything he wanted to do and um for a while he you know he felt a little pressure um cuz I was doing all kinds of things but I wanted him to just be a man of God a good person and I didn't care what he did as long as he was good productive and gave back to the community um I'll always be proud of him and he made a lot of sacrifices um for me to be able to serve the citizens to be able to serve the community and so he's not here he's that school today um but I'm I'm sure he'll go back and look at this but um I love him dearly and I thank him um for being patient for doing his work when I couldn't help him do his work but just listening to his mother so um kudos to Nick but I have to say this to the council this Council as a whole and had a conversation with um then my um commission chief of staff and I don't know if she's here uh Captain Raven batist and we talked about this Council
and we said you know this is um it's refreshing that we had a council who were really pushing to get things done that was a big help not just with policing but with so many things that are going on in the city each and every one of you I see you I hear you and I recognize all the work you're doing every day to make the city better whether it's with infrastructure the budget or policing the DA’s office NORC you guys are out there doing the work tackling so many issues but for me personally I want to thank you all for your support the calls your guidance checking in being there when I needed it Joe no we didn’t have to go to your house but of course I knew I’d catch you at Dana’s house I didn’t go to Les’s house but yeah I saw him and as soon as I saw the look in his eye I started talking and then I realized it wasn’t just business it’s a social thing sometimes it’s about getting together and figuring things out as we go it’s not always just about the job but the relationships we build along the way I’m grateful for all of you and as we work to improve this city I want to acknowledge that all of your efforts whether big or small make a difference thank you for everything you do to mine yeah no no no she she was like she didn't want to talk about that and then um of course councilman King we sat down we met many times talked about so many different things and of course um Jay just like that same weekend I cost to Jason I costed you I was trying to get to everybody all you know all at once and then of course um council member U morale you know having that family thing and of course you know Tai being my friend and my classmate you know so of course we had that relationship but being able to talk to you um being able to call you and you feeling comfortable to call me and call me out on the carpet on some things just that each and every one every one of you did and I was there to get it I was there to listen and make sure I immediately was going to do something about it because I wanted to really really do a good job and of course um councilman green always always always supportive of everything that is policing and definitely was supportive would be out there with me everybody kept asking why are you going on all these homicide scenes but councilman green would be right there standing next to me on those scenes so so um I appreciate that and of course Oliver OT Thomas I don't I I don't even know how to begin um to thank you because I'll tell you what a lot of you guys don't know a lot of people don't know and I would laugh about it all the time before I probably was a sergeant or a lieutenant I've been knowing Oliver a very long time he's been knowing my family a long time every time I saw him he said hey chief and I would laugh you know I thought that was so funny because I wasn't a chief I was a sergeant or Lieutenant but he said it he spoke it into fruition um he believed in me um he fought to the Bitter End and like the kids say he stood 10 toes down to the very end and I cannot begin to tell you the debt I'm I'm so appreciative of your belief in me and telling me that I was smart in that last conversation with Dr Penny um uh Peter sharf um in in your office that conversation you don't you know that what came out of that conversation was this and I know you're going to laugh because you guys talked to me about being confident um being confident in everything that I did um and don't shy away from saying yes we did this or yes um I feel good about some of the decisions that I made and what came out of that comment was the shoeing comment I said oh my God they had me feeling so high and they had me feeling so confident that's what I said it came like a day or two later because I thought about what the um great Peter sharp said what a great Dr Penny said in that room I needed to hear that um and it not only it may not uh show in the work that I did with the New Orleans Police Department but in the next things that I am going to do my next career move um it is definitely going to show there right Jason amen yeah amen but again um thank you for the opportunity um to serve thank you for the opportunity to serve in that capacity thanks for each and every one of you um calling me and calling me out call the department out on my things and stuff like that but I really appreciate each and every one of you because you made it very easy because I again I wasn't a politician I'm not a politician and so I was like oh my God how am I going to navigate the council you know that was my big thing and so you made it easy by um communicating even even if we didn't agree on something we could at least discuss it and come to some type of agreement so I really appreciate everything that um you did to make my time as interim superintendent very easy and to the men and women of the New Orleans Police Department my second family I miss y'all y'all call me every day um yeah I'm at home and someone calls me every day from work what are you doing how's retirement and so that just makes me miss them all the more you know but to the men and women of the New Orleans Police Department when I and I mean this from with everything that I am this is the most special group of people that you're ever going to meet um serve the community and work with they are um different they care they're engaged they want things to be better in the city they are working tirelessly now I know we talk about the numbers but they have done more with less and that is with the leadership that was in place you know I could sit here and take credit for everything but it wasn't me and it's it never was about me it was about getting them the things that they needed it was about um uplifting those officers who are on the beat every day who are out there taking the calls for service who are doing the hard work who are listening to the executive team and shout out to my executive team um they came in they listened to what I had to say I listened to what they had to say and together as a team we came up with the ideas that we came up with we came up with the strategies that we used while I was the interim superintendent in that the superintendent continues to use and thank you for doing that um it worked and it all the credit goes to them they listen they got the work done yes we know we didn't agree on everything all the time but again that compromise that communication the command staff and all the officers our civilian corps we can't you can't um have a police department without the civilian professional staff and that's what um council member U Moreno talked about we cannot be a successful police department without those civilians they are important the work that they do whether they're be a social worker a tech um a crime lab specialist so many people do so many things on a police department there are so many great men and women there who are committed and they do it because they love it and I just can't say enough about them so I want to thank them for all their support um for um giving me the opportunity to lead them I'll be always be forever grateful they'll always be my family and I'll always be there for the New Orleans Police Department loving each every one of those people dearly for all the work that they do and chief and thank you for allowing me to um to help

Williams man really came in really right away supporting asking me what can we do how can we make things better and we're going to continue on that in my next move we're going to continue on that path

all the matters on the consent agenda all right thank you Madam clerk uh Mr Burnside you're first up with public comment so in regards the regulation of our utilities um I'm here to State the obvious which is come September I probably end up in jail uh so September 2023 was sort of like the midpoint of our discussion ongoing about the utility poll at the corner of Magnolia and Felicity I stopped by there yesterday and took a good look at it um it's rotted it's got a arm metal arm hanging off of it from which is hanging a traffic light so those of us who love physics that's a recipe for torque and torque is a fancy name for Twist so come a hurricane the whole thing's going to come down and it would be really good if curo had the ability to either put out some sort of RFP and got a contractor to fix it before 4 months is up or it'd be really nice if DPW would send out a contract to get it fixed for the four months is up because I'm really too old to play the game of Quakers everywhere which is on uh you know Nagasaki day go stand in front of a nuclear bomb facility and get arrested um so what frustrates me is I've tried to play inside the game so I'm in receipt of an email saying wait 60 days because the previous RFP had nobody respond to it and so after 68 days I sent out an email back saying hey you know 68 days you guys asked me to wait 60 and I got zero response from anybody so 60 days of course is two months and we've only got 4 months left four years up and I think it's starting to be slightly ridiculous and I would keep talking about it but I'm tired I'm going to go sit down thank you Mr [Applause] Burnside this looks like Hakeem Morad I'm having trouble reading your writing come on up followed by Joshua tanam tan bomb good morning good morning council members I'm against the adoption of a contract with Wexford Health sources to provide services for inmates at Orleans Justice Center I'm against this bill because I do not believe we should give our taxpayer dollars to a company that supports uh with a history of medical neglect and torture in 2014 it was found that they were KN only violating prisoner uh constitutional rights and doing things such as forcing women to go into cesarian section Etc it's facing several lawsuits and in adequate healthare as a Palestinian I'm also all too familiar with medical neglect of individuals and harsh environments like prisons the state of Israel has 10,000 political prisoners currently most recently Samar isma a member of US citizen member of New Orleans a grandmother with medical issues was ignored um and abducted from her home for Israel it is the eradication torture and genocide of my people that they want most hopefully by now you've received the last couple months our email emails our phone calls we've also showed up in person uh to this Hall um and at first we we brought up 10,000 uh killed 20,000 30,000 it is now standing at 40,000 uh Palestinians killed in 6 months of which 70% is women and children you may also be aware of the forced Famine of 2 million people in Rua but with the time I have today I don't want to focus on the numbers maybe we can do that over meeting and and and personal discussions I want to tell you a story something that lives vividly for me and and many of the members here that came today um this is the first televised genocide of our of our lifetime and maybe uh of anyone's lifetime we it is the month of Ramadan as well where Muslims fast from sun up to sun down and make prayer throughout the whole night we pray for the oppressed we pray for the uh for the sick we pray for the for God to protect people but recently there's one video that keeps coming up in my mind as I fall asleep there's this one man a father in Gaza who screams verily I will wish my children were dead than to hear their cries every morning begging me to get a piece of bread for them and then I wake up and I look at my daughter's face and I ask myself how could he How could a man wants want to his children to be dead as opposed to you know uh as opposed to living on this Earth because they are struggling so badly the Earth is so poor for them we could do something about this you say well this is issues over there how can I fix this well the city council has issued statements last stat last statement is city council has issued statements regarding the the loss of life in Israel but has not made the same for the Palestinian people I hope that you will take the time and meet with us we have we have reached out to you multiple occasions and we can discuss personally I appreciate the time thank you Mr mad Joshua T Joshua tanom all right are you Mr Tan bomb hi um are you Mr Tan bom I'm MR Title bom yeah perfect yep um thank you city council I am against the adoption of a contract with Wexford Health Services to provide service for inmates at Orleans Justice Center uh New Orleans should not give our taxpayer dollars to a company with the history of a consent decree against it which is failing to comply with which um brings to mind for me uh Israel's failure to comply with International court of justice provisional measures designed to prevent an ongoing genocide this city has before taken action uh in the case of South Africa had taken binding resolutions to do the right thing to stand on the right side of History to not be complicit to divest to express its uh disapproval with the actions of an apthe regime um I'm also the grandchild of Holocaust survivors I would not be here if not for people doing the right thing some decent people among many people who are otherwise complicit This is how genocide happens Cities carry on business as usual and pretend like it’s not happening This is how Jim Crow happened in the South This is how Nazi Germany happened This is how apartheid South Africa happened and this is how apartheid Israel happens where people’s rights are determined based on their ethnicity or as Israel determines who’s in an ethnonational group That’s like what happens in this country when people tell us who’s a real American and who’s not a real American who deserves rights and who doesn’t There are segregated roads There are different laws for different people living in the same place That should be reminiscent of things here unfortunately and this city has a history to address that it should be addressing this matter Please meet with those of us who have contacted you to speak about a ceasefire resolution This city is shamefully silent when 120 other cities are not Thank you so much Thank you Mr Tanom The next person is Shas Shas Vasudev Thank you My name is Shas Vasudev and I’m here with No Ship and Louisiana for Palestine to speak against the adoption of a contract with Wexford Health Services to provide services for inmates at Orleans Justice Center I’m against this bill for the reason given by the previous speakers but I’m here to say that we’ve been unable to meet with any of you on a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza but agenda items like this face no such scrutiny or difficulty Last week five World Central Kitchen aid workers were deliberately killed by Israel to send a message that not even aid workers are safe This same organization has served over a million meals in New Orleans during the pandemic after Ida New Orleans and Gaza are both being served by this organization and that’s not a coincidence New Orleans knows racist brutality It knows disaster It knows infrastructure collapse It knows injustice and oppression It knows the importance of resistance to these systems It knows the importance of humanitarian aid New Orleans knows Samaher and demands her freedom It cries in remembrance of its own child Thik killed by the government of Israel We’ve been in these halls and in these streets for six months in growing numbers to stand in solidarity with Palestinians We’ve been emailing you coming to your events calling your offices all in good faith trying to work with y’all 125 other resolutions have passed across the U S We have 3000 petition signatures from people in this city It’s a shame we have to resort to creative means just to speak with y’all but this is how much it means to us This is how much it means to all of us All of these people 1% of the amount of people in this city that care about standing in solidarity with Palestine and care about a ceasefire resolution dropped everything at a last minute notice to come to this meeting to show up today Please respond to our emails We are wishing to work with you We wish to speak with you That’s all we’re asking for Thank you Thank you [Applause] Sir and the last public comment The last public comment I have is Noah Ramen Thank you council people for your time As to the crowd behind me I can’t follow a performance like this that but I just want to say that I'm in sympathy with their concerns um and I hope that uh their uh Council will engage with their constituents as to motion M 24126 which I wanted to comment on this looks to be the renewal of the city's uh contract with DigiTech for EMS billing services and it seems to have been renewed for quite a few years now and I have to wonder if there's been a competitive bidding process for the last few years with as a student at Tain in the physics department I can say there's a lot going on in the world of AI and large language models lately and especially even just down this road at the University of Florida is working on a lot of clinical large language models that really promise to revolutionize the billing space and people locally are working on them as well at my liberty to say that much so I would hope that the Community Development Committee and the city in the future are are forward-looking and maybe want to look at solutions that might lower cost and improve EMS performance and maybe you know in the near future this won't be the uncompetitive contract it seems to be I would just urge the city to be forward looking about AI Solutions in this EMS billing space thank you for your time thank you sir any public comment online no public comment online silence is not a solution it's been moved by council member GRE [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] second silence is not solution resolution not a solution resence is not a solution resolution [Applause] all right Madam clerk we can go to the noon item which is item 21 um council member Harris we're on top of page 36 a legislative grouping we have ordinance calendar number 34,5 96 by council member Harris by request an ordinance authorizing the acquisition of a portion of square RP 6X lot a 6 a6b in the first Municipal District bounded by Annunciation street faure street the Pont Tran Expressway chapula street malamine street Municipal address 28726 mamine Street here in after reference as the portion of square [Music] rp-6gb Hall Authority authorizing the dedication of the portion of square [Music] rp-6gb by Annunciation of chapula Street heing after referenced as the malamine street portion revoking the street dedication of the malamine street portion authorizing the transfer of the malamine street portion from the City of New Orleans to Ernest in moral New Orleans exhibition Hall Authority in exchange for the portion of square rp-640d 96 by council member Harris on page three in section three delete lines 13-15 and replace them with the following number two the street relocation plan must be approved by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and development that is the amendment thank you madam clerk uh before we get into it I'd like to go ahead and move to adopt the amendment this simply corrects the ordinance for consistency with CP uh C staff report providing that dot approval is required for the street relocation plan and in this case the approval already came in in form of a letter of compliance so I'm going to go ahead and move I need a second seconded by council member Marino all in favor you need another one com I need one more and while we're waiting why don't we have CPC staff come up um as well as Jeff Schwarz all right so the amendment is passed um now on to the ordinance as amended uh this obviously is an item that's drawn a lot of attention and frankly a lot of misinformation so let me lay out very clearly the action that's before the council today the ordinance authorizes a land swap just like the council approved at last council meeting for Duncan Plaza without any Fanfare specifically it authorizes the mayor to exchange about half an acre of the city-owned portion of melamine street right away for half an acre of the state-owned portion of melamine Street and when I say state owned that means the convention center so what we're talking about is two pieces of land with negligible difference in size and cost CPC who is here today recommended approval on the two pieces of the exchange both the disposition of the city and property and the acquisition of the state-owned property and Bob Rivers is here to speak on that later uh uh as we move on the department of property management who's also here today reviewed the exchange and is in support and that is the charter required step in the process and again they are here today the purpose of this land swap is to improve traffic flow which will create pedestrian access and provide an overall benefit for the larger River District development because of its ties to the River District there is a misconception that today's ordinance will effectively determine whether Top Golf will be permitted that's wrong Top Golf has already received its building permits from the city last December and is moving forward regardless of our vote today furthermore the land where Top Golf is slated to be built has allowed outdoor Amusement facilities as a permitted byright use under the city zoning laws since at least 2015 and that's why top gol felt comfortable enough to lease the property from uh r dni by approving today's land swap we simply ensure a safer better designed right of way for the general public and to be clear I will repeat what I've said many many times before my support for the River District including the top golf project is premised on rdn delivery of 900 housing units 450 of which must be priced at the affordable or Workforce level this is spelled out as a legal requirement of rdn in many places including its lease with the convention center and it's also in the ca that governs the entire project on that note I'm proud to say that leading up to the council's consideration of the mamine swap I took the opportunity to push the developer to renegotiate the ca we passed back in December and today we've introduced that revised CA which first and foremost will include the city and Council as parties I also double down on the affordable housing benefits and I expect our dni development team to deliver those affordable housing units there will now be a restricted affordable housing Reserve account where half of all of our dni's additional taxes will be will be deposited and available only to support the 450 units of affordable Workforce housing and the infrastructure necessary for that development and remember that these additional taxes are an additional two pennies in sales tax and two pennies in hotel occupancy tax on top of all other city and state taxes that apply for Top Golf that's estimated to generate $14 million over the next 30 Years and please remember that the entire development that the River District is developing is on state-owned property that has sat empty for over 30 years generating zero revenue of any kind I want to thank my colleagues on this Council for their contributions on the ca which I know we will publicly discuss much more at a future meeting and before we get back to melamine the matter at hand today I would like to clarify one thing contrary to what has been stated top golf is not receiving City benefits it has no tax abatement and no Tiff it is on the hook for any and all of its taxes and again a percentage of those taxes will go to support affordable housing every component of this project has followed legal processes required and this land swap is no exception CPC Property Management DPW safety and permits have conducted every review required by state and city laws and policies on top of that I specifically ask the law department and Council to the city council to individually verify that the exchange would be legal sound and it will be and I know we have residents from the area here today and I know that you're disappointed but that does not determine whether Top Golf is coming to New Orleans it is but I will continue to push that Corporation to value your quality of life and invest in the neighborhood in the same way all new orleanians do I urge the Lower Garden District Association and top golf to come to a good neighbor agreement that then can be put in supervisors that control that agreement I've spoken enough right now so I'd like to turn it over to CPC um Bob will you go ahead and uh report on the exchange yes thank you uh my name is Bob Rivers the director of the City Planning Commission um the matter before us today is um the exchange of a portion of melamine Street uh between enunciation and chapula streets um for the technical uh purposes of the city planning commission's process uh this comes in two phases one is a disposition of city-owned property and the second is the acquisition of uh the convention center owned property um the uh City Planning Commission uh held a hearing on this matter on I'm sorry December in December um and the City Planning Commission recommended approval um of both halves of this matter um I and my staff are here and available for any questions you all might have do any of my fellow city council people have any questions okay with that I will turn to public comment we have a lot of cars I will remind everyone that you must state your name and address and you are limited to 2 minutes to speak if you go over that 2 minutes I will urge you to wrap up um and because we have a lot of cards we are sticking to that two minutes so first up is Zach Smith okay no Zach Smith Matt Smith good afternoon council president as as well as fellow council members I am Matt Smith senior director of real estate for Top Golf on behalf of over 30,000 Top Golf Associates I am thankful to be before you today we are very proud and very committed to be the initial anchor of the River District project I am speaking obviously in support of today's ordinance which is to realign melamine Street which again ensures good traffic flow and pedestrian safety once Top Golf opens this ordinance is further supported by a traffic study and that traffic study has been reviewed and approved by New Orleans uh Department of Public Works and has also received a certificate of right to weigh in on the project second unresolved traffic issues related to Port Nola and DOD in an already congested traffic area with very weak streets third the lack of environmental impact studies in an urban setting for the sound level lighting and Aven issues fourth a lack of committed funding for the housing past top golf's contribution which is the significant reason that the city and its supporters have backed this project lastly Top Golf would be towering over the city's landmarks with over a dozen 175 foot poles connected by Nets blasting music lit up brightly until after 2 a.m. on weekends now it would be wedged into a residential neighborhood so close to housing they are literally attaching the lighting onto an apartment building and its parking structure while also requiring a street to be moved just so they can bury this venue on the parcel this is not the right place for a business like this especially where the quality of life of the existing community in the area is not being considered New Orleans used to be protective of historic neighborhoods and this project flies in the face of that especially in one of the city's most nationally recognized historic neighborhood Lindsay that's your time thank you Andrew Yan followed by Michael Eric fide uh good afternoon my name is Andrew Yan I live at 1532 Camp Street for the last 22 years I'm a member and former president of the Lower Garden District Association I'd like to start by thanking all of you for meeting with us uh me and a couple of my colleagues over the last several weeks that meant a lot to us to get a chance to make our case to you prior to our two-minute time slot today a big problem in the world today is that people can't seem to agree on basic facts so here's a fact and it is indisputable Rd and I put 175t height provision and the text Amendment but did not tell anyone it was for Top Golf until after the text Amendment M passed and we have demonstrated that in our letters to you and the information we posted online they say otherwise that the correct process was followed and they did everything they were supposed to and we are spreading misinformation this is called projection and AR does it a lot projection is where you take your own flaws and you project them onto your adversary and call them their flaws our information is solid the facts are on our side we are the truth tellers here this because we are telling the truth many people and neighborhood organizations around the city are on our side these people including many of your constituents agree with us that good process leads to better results and bad process leads to bad results most agree that Top Golf on the edge of a historic neighborhood is a bad result Arina did what developers must learn in developer School keep your controversial stuff quiet as long as possible they have succeeded in that using every trick in the book so here we are today with our first genuine chance to have our voice heard and affect the outcome of this project please hold the hold r and i accountable force them persuade them require them to follow good process do not give them what they want today use today to start giving yourselves and the citizens a meaningful voice in this process please vote to oppose the melamine L swap thank you Andrew Michael Eric Burnside followed by Janine Steven Michael Eric Burnside 2215 Felicity um two minutes is not a lot of time so I'm just going to hit the high points the super doome came into the City and it's a very um very illustrative example of how agreements change over time before 2000 Superdome gave some money to the city after 200000 the supern Nome did not give any more money to the city I do not doubt that at the beginning the additional revenues will exist and flow into a fund but I doubt that that will actually last through the entirety of the process the next thing I want to uh mention casually is that if pedestrian safety is an issue here a long time ago I sent an email highlighting how the University of Arizona has an underground pedestrian walkway that allows its students to safely Traverse a very dangerous high-speed interior City Highway if safety is the issue then an underground beautiful large wide pedestrian access access tunnel isn't really a tunnel uh it's basically turning the the what would be chapula here into a bridge should be built and yes it will cost more money but it will also be extremely safe for pedestrians the next thing I want to hit on is April 10th I've been told that April 10th is when the meeting for the Louisiana Housing Corporation is going to happen as to whether there is actually going to be State money involved in the affordable housing uh component of our dni is PR promise to us uh this is April 4th it would seem to me wisdom to have delayed this vote until after April 10th uh it's one thing to receive a letter from the Louisiana Department of Transportation it would be additionally good to receive a letter from the Louisiana Housing corporation that says yes in fact there is money for these dreams the dreams in question it's a yellow light are Workforce housing which will provide housing at 120% of Ami there is no no one to me contractual obligation for any affordable housing which of course is 80% of Ami that's your time thank you Colin helstein followed by Susan Johnson Colin Colin all right he's in opposition Susan Johnson Susan Johnson I'm here representing Louisiana Landmark Society speaking on behalf of Sandra Stokes advocacy chair the address is 1440 Moss excuse me Louisiana Landmark Society stands with the Lower Garden District in opposing the move of melamine to make room for Top Golf please do not give away a public Street for a private profit Endeavor that will will permanently Mar the Lower Garden District moving a street should be performed only for the public good not to benefit a commercial concern and proper public process is imperative we ask that the council defer this issue please until the section 106 process regarding this project is complete and all information is on the table we need to understand impacts of sound light and traffic on adjacent on the adjacent historic neighborhood and safety impacts of Bright Lights facing the interstate and ramps prior to this boat to swap melamine an appraisal must be performed to ensure equal value of the exchange we see no evidence this has happened it should also be made public and vetted by the city and the community we also oppose the deeply flawed de development process that has brought us to this point a project this enormous so disruptive to the community deserves maximum scrutiny and discussion instead the process lacks transparency and opportunities for Community dialogue it would began with the first NPP when neighbors were shown a pretty picture of affordable housing and amenities that included a grocery and Retail Top Golf facility with its 175 ft poles netting accompanying lighting is well suited to a Suburban industrial setting it definitely should not be located next to lows scale that's your time residential Community like the go low lower Gard District thank you thank you Matt Ryan followed by Jamie Mueller Matt Ryan good morning I'm Matt Ryan I live at 10:17 U um I've been a banker for 30 years in my other life when I wasn't a bumbling neighborhood activist and um I've been trying to figure out this deal how developers can big- time developers can come in and and pitch a deal with affordable housing an African-American Museum and then a grocery store and then leverage that into a text amendment that gives them all their zoning and then as soon as they get that that text Amendment say oops sorry it's really going to be a top golf but it's a surprise that's cool um and you know there're two kinds of Lies they're lying by commission and lying by omission and I don't want to start a theological debate but um and also there's not really any funding for the African-American Museum sorry um but it seems like that that behavior would make people not not trust you and it it still didn't make sense and I was thinking why is this happening and then it hit me they they can't afford this and they knew that from the beginning there was no way that they were going to be able to to start off with affordable housing but they said they were going to anyway they want to do this like that 80s infam bu real estate with no money down that's what these guys are doing and they they they it's it's like they're turning the City of New Orleans into the special man it's terrible and um I would like y'all to please vote against this land swap because past Behavior will tell you that that this affordable housing deal is not happening they've had two opportunities to do it so far I haven't done it and and in banking we're be we be that's your time with balance sheets Jamie Mueller followed by Katie Grace bow Jamie Muer can you hear me council members Jamie Mueller 1118 Orange Street it's telling that the River District developers natural instinct is to accuse regular new orlans of misinformation and wanting the city to fail sure as regular schlubs want to volunteer for countless hours just to work against our own self-interest and tear down the city and stop progress give me a break the community speaking out against the top top golf are the only people demanding the affordable housing immediately affordable housing that was presented to
go in this parcel from the beginning so the River District developers must stop with their strawman arguments because we can all see through it and I'm sure you all at the city council are tired of their gaslighting as well if the public is wrong about something if we're not fully actualized to their grand plan then that merely proves our point that the community outreach has been non-existent I cite their lack of a single post on social media about any NPP not one their social media outreach has been abysmal right up until they started feeling the heat from the public personally I don't know how any serious person can claim that a top golf is either the best use of 12 acres of prime public land or that a top it's a top off that must save the City of New Orleans but if the River District developers are holding some great insight into why their wild assessments are correct they should have been forthright with the community from the beginning in March of 2022 and hashed it out through a transparent process since apparently a top golf is always what they intended to build instead they bait and switched us the River District developers chose to play slight of hand and they were caught and now we can't trust them and RD and I the leader of a multi-billion dollar development is still trying to silence The public's opinion and questions and concerns concerns and in a world where the Hard Rock tragedy happened no less but the River District cannot delete these comments Council you have the power to stop their intellectual dishonesty hit pause and drag this project into the light to provide the scrutiny it deserves because if it passes now the river District's Legacy will always be based on their snowballing lies so please vote no Katie Grace Bower followed by Gary Solomon Katie Grace she's in support Gary Solomon good morning uh thank you uh each of you for listening to all these comments today uh I need you to know that you know my involvement in the Civic City here in our town has been forever and when I have no contact no relationship no business relationship with anyone involved in this I have to tell you in November 2019 I moved my corporate office to Dallas because of the lack of be being able to get the business people
who I needed to come here to work for me to come here when I saw this project I thought it was the best thing I have seen for New Orleans since Katrina when the opportunities we had then you know Top Golf is just one piece of it and I do know in other Ci's Top Golf is a big draw for tourists especially those that are having conventions I'm happy to know the owner of top golf over in Dallas when he first started at the first one so any sign that I see that says that we're not open for business in New Orleans has bothers me because I think people watch people know the people with money are thriving in Nashville's and Charlottes and those cities so I got
involved and spoke up very heavily in favor of the River District because I want to see the business community and those who are willing to invest their money in our town to be appreciated not to be given anything but to be appreciated and to be able to show that they can do business in New Orleans so I thank you for listening today and I hope that you support top and the whole River District thank you Todd James followed by lisis LEL lorell thank you council members good morning I'm Todd James with Broadmore LLC a part of the development uh and a part of the development team with River District neighborhood investors um here's an agent on behalf of the convention center uh Mr saai is here uh the head of the convention center and as a manager of the infrastructure package for our development I'm here to answer any questions and provide info if on this vote on this matter first thank you all for your consideration on the land swap today the city in a convention center for the city and the convention center to rout mamine Street into better align it with choa tulas and its inherent Improvement of traffic flow and um at an intersection as a part of our overall River District development I want to assure you and the public we have made our way through our all of our proper planning and coordination with authorities that have jurisdiction excuse me and making sure that we satisfied all of those requirements in particular we have commissioned the traffic studies necessary for this measure considering input from all of our appropriate stakeholders including Public Works DOD the convention center the port and our neighbors with tulan University as a result of these extensive coordination points with the Planning Commission and Public Works we believe we have devised the appropriate plan where rerouting mamine Street would not only uh benefit the involvement of our development improving traffic flow uh alignment of vehicular access and
walkability but most importantly protecting what is a considered to be a offset of how these vehicles can impact denunciation Street to the Lakes side of our development with this in mind I do ask you all to uh vote in favor of the and Swap and again I'm here if you guys have any questions thank you thank you Lis lella followed by Quinton marks good afternoon I'm Lewis laurella co-managing member of River District neighborhood LLC I want to thank each of you on the council and each of your staff members for working diligently with our team over the past few months we are pleased to be in partnership with you as we advance development plans for the River District and I thank each of you for your commitment and opportunity for us to get to this point I would especially like to give a big shout out to council member Harris who brokered the agreement for the city to be part of the cea that governs the bonding and taxing authority over the district we recognize that this was a critical step to establish a true partnership between the city and the River District team as we work directly with each of you towards this this end I trust we have demonstrated an abundance of goodwi throughout our team remains steadfast in its commitment to a better New Orleans as we realize our vision for the River District because it offers a once in a-lifetime opportunity for our city I'm hopeful you will approve the land swap that is before you today as this accommodation will help ensure that the enduser can achieve its desired potential and thereby provide significant financial employment and social dividends to the people of New Orleans our project managers intentionally plan the rerouting of meline Street in close coordination with the appropriate city and state departments to accomplish the best possible plans for the development and to allow Optimum traffic flow for neighbors and businesses finally I want to recognize and applaud the support of New Orleans Chamber of Commerce New Orleans and Company gno Inc in the New Orleans business business Alliance thank you for your consideration of our project plans and support for this transformational project Quinton marks Quinton marks followed by Kevin Ferguson Quinton marks thank you Council I'll keep my comments short uh having been born and raised in New Orleans I've seen this F this land l v lay vacant my whole life um this is the start of a transform transformative project that will truly benefit the City of New Orleans and its residents thank youall thank you Kevin Ferguson followed by David Waller good afternoon council members Kevin Ferguson representing New Orleans and Company 2020 St Charles Avenue um we submitted a letter of support co-authored with Nola ba greater New Orleans incorporated as well as the New Orleans chamber and we have sandre list here I know Peter Wagner's here as well from G Inc and I just want to read a few comments from that letter for everybody here greater New Orleans Inc New Orleans Inc company New Orleans business Alliance and New Orleans chamber of commerce's missions all converge at the intersection of creating a city in a region with a thriving economy and an excellent quality of life for everyone one of the ways we achieved this is by attracting businesses that will employ our future Workforce and drive our economy forward in this vein we write to you to underscore the importance and value of the River District for New Orleans and express our support for Top Golf as a partner in the development Central to our advocacy for the River District is the Project's commitment to affordable housing in close proximity to major job centers by introducing 900 multi family residences 450 of which are designated as affordable housing we address a critical need ensuring that our growth includes everyone and contributes to more Equitable Community um I know the council here as well is dedicated to improving affordable housing in New Orleans council M Harris I know we've been working for quite a while to address homelessness in the city I think a lot about that chapais encampment I think about the 1500 people in our community that are unhoused and those units and additional units that are coming online will help support that I also think about a tragic incident that happened in the power plant a couple years ago where a young man died young man that graduated from the same high school I went to we have to bring these areas back in Commerce we have to develop it thank you for your consideration and your support thank you David Waller followed by Peter wager so thank you councilman I'm just a citizen here in town and just calling to thank you for your time today and I'm here to ask for your support for this land swap um all I would say is that I've had a chance to travel many places in my life and go to many conventions and a lot of cases where you go to travel cities Vegas is a good example there's a top golf place that's walkable from where you are and I think that's one of the key aspects of this is that it it it makes the uh the venue attractive to companies that want to come here to hold a convention and that's a bit big part of our success here in New Orleans is our convention business so having this is to me is a key piece of that puzzle and I would think that should it should be something that the community would support because if you look at what's been there for the last 20 years it's a truck marshalling yard so why you would want a truck marshalling yard in your backyard for 20 years versus a lovely Green Space it may have fence around it but it's been a truck marshalling yard for 20 years this is a significant Improvement and will help New Orleans attract other conventions that want to come here thank you for your time today thank you Peter wager Peter Wagner followed by MX Turner hi council members thank you Peter Wagner greater New Orleans Inc 1100 Poria Street great gno Inc the regional Economic Development Organization for the 10 parishes of Southeast Louisiana is supportive of this ordinance in all efforts to advance the River District we recognize the River District as a generational Economic Development opportunity that will be the largest private non-energy project in the history of our state the mixed use development will bring together office residential commercial and amenities like Top Golf while investing in infrastructure and storm water management that make the new neighborhood a new National model for resilience in workfor Workforce access as you know the River District has committed to providing affordable Workforce housing that will Aid Workforce access and economic Mobility Top Golf itself is fostering Partnerships with organizations to engage Workforce and underserve youth as um a whole the River District will be invaluable in reestablishing New Orleans as a destination for young professionals who are seeking Cory mixed use living environments um to their peers and thriving metros currently like DC Austin and Nashville this cluster and prox imity of talent and activity will be a boon to attracting and retaining headquarters as evidenced by the shell development and have Ripple effects that benefit e economic outcomes across our city and region so we thank you for your consideration of this project and its economic impact um at this critical intersection for investment in our region thank you thank you MX Turner MX Turner 1628 North Street the fairgrounds neighborhood I'm here representing New Orleans I'm here representing other neighborhoods that will get this done to them Miss Harris I'm talking I'm talking do you do you hear us because you gloated about how this is a done deal council member that this is a done deal which gives rise to the question why are any of us talking I have notes and I'll put it on the record but if you're proud of the fact this is already already a done deal with you doing the dness it seems like a kabuki show here here are my notes first of all it was a it was a study done of traffic done by the developer you know I read comic books when I was a kid but I knew they were fake you know the Playbook that these suits are using to get you to go along with the deal is like one of those comic books they will not come through and you know this you know this to be the case young professionals here that's one of the deals what about black masking Indians what about people in the lower 99th what about people in the East you know they're not going to see the benefits of this tax breaks for an office building for Shell that doesn't help anybody but shell they're in a perfectly fine office building right now affordable housing to who and by the time it gets built for who I want you to think about that I want all of you to think about that I know do the developer do you really think that this is the best juice River District people do you never mind you're just going to lie to us anyway I don't want to hear your answer people don't come to New Orleans to hit golf balls off of 175 ft netted platform they come to New Orleans for what New Orleans is and I'm just going to say I have a lot of notes but I'm just going to tell you one thing you're gaslighting us with this whole idea that this was an open process you're gaslighting us with the idea that this is for the people of New Orleans you're gaslighting us with the idea that this is what New Orleans is about that's and those gas lights are 175 ft up in the air that's your time Janine Stevens Janine Stevens Janine Stevens hi hi can you'all hear me okay okay thank you uh my name is Jean Stevens I live at 1370 Consin street I'm uh currently the Lower Garden District Association Treasurer and I've been uh involved with the organization since 2014 I live in the Lower Garden District and I am I support Economic Development I posos the land swap because the characteristics of this project as described by the River District Developers don't line up also because there has been no critical scrutiny by City a agencies for such a highly impactful project in a historic neighborhood I'm going to read some quotes from the river District's February 2022 video presentation Tara Hernandez we are creating a new New Orleans neighborhood that will have its own distinctions but be representative of the characteristics and traditions of our great New Orleans Peter mwin there's an intimacy to the scale of New Orleans that we're very much interested in retaining video continues a neighborhood in which the architecture is the neighborhood will be the architecture is timeless in character and design to enhance the neighborhood sense of place and its cultural heritage a dynamic destination that represents the city Rich the city's Rich cultural heritage while pointing to a bright and Innovative future the future development will be cohesive and consistent with the rest of the neighborhood this sounds fantastic what we're actually getting is a top Gulf that is slapped against an apartment building with a driving range view of a highway Interstate I'm not sure what precedent this sets for the future Parcels development of the rest of River District but it doesn't feel quote cohesive and consistent with the Lower Garden District much less bright and Innovative it feels forced and the opposite of thoughtful also if this development in this parcel of land wasn't good enough in 2019 according to Governor Edwards the developer Joe joerger who pulled out of the project and at the time District district B council person Jay Banks then why is it good enough now what changed because I've been at every Community that's your time okay thank you thank you I have cards from I have cards from colen Manus who's in support Alex Hernandez who's in support Tucker Crawford in support and Colin mamas Colin my name is Colin momis I'm the managing director of North company's local development team uh focused on uh redeveloping blighted properties and uh putting underused um property back into Commerce um I am not a part of this development uh but uh similar to what Mr Solomon said earlier uh pay attention to business opportunities and pay attention to what's happening in the city um and how it's perceived outside the city from investors uh and people who are seeing development happen um from my perspective I think um look what's what's being said right now is trying to litigate whether or not Top Golf should be here I think that um whether or not it's a desired use or not uh it is a business use and it is something I think that is permitted and I think this project uh is is going to be transformative uh over the next 20 years can be one of the greatest projects we've had in the city uh I've talked to a number of developers uh on the team and understand the thoughtfulness of what's going in uh what's at hand right now is a land swap which I believe uh everything has been taken into account um and the the the legalities of what needs to be done I'm in full support of this land swap I hope to see this River District very successful over the next few years and I hope the impact that we see over the next 20 years is what we're all hoping so thank Youk you Angela oburn hello I'm Angelo bur I'm a local architect and I just want to say I'm in favor of this development I think it's really exciting and I'd love to see that investment made in the city I happen to live nearby I'm in Central City at 2427 Reverend John Rafael Junior way and I play golf and I'm going to be there if it gets built hope hope you all vote in favor thank you thank you I think that's it for public comment um Anita can you read 10 minutes of online public comment half for those in support and half for those who are opposed and then the rest will be put on the record sure start with post uh first comment is from Amanda Krauss she says top golf is not needed or wanted in the Lower Garden District there's another golf place currently being built Less Than 3 mil away the tax break and 99-year lease on public land without our consent is Shady and takes away money from us and our children not having a written timeline for the construction of public affordable housing gives the developers a way to skirt around completing the construction we want to keep the Integrity of our historic neighborhood and top golf is not it if we had been if we had been given a vote I and my husband would have voted no representative Harris has lost all trust by doing this deal behind our back next comment is from Amber votes if we care about the culture of New Orleans we will not build a top golf I quote Andrew Yan if you ask 100 urban planners how to use this property in a way that's good for the community and good for our city and good for historic neighborhood not a single one would say Top Golf next comment is from Calvin heinstein this amendment uh shouldn't be needed if there was proper planning to begin with we need to talk about what's going really going on with top golf's project it's not just about fake Golf and tourism it's about the heart and soul of the city that we love living here is already Death By A Thousand Cuts it's not an accident that we're experiencing some of the worst population declines in the country and issues like this top golf Fiasco make it impossible to have hope that we'll ever actually fix our problems it's not a secret that R dni the convention center and the city are pulling some shady moves behind the scenes they're not playing fair and they're definitely not listening to us the people who actually live here but let me let me be clear we cannot allow our City's unique history and it's one of a kind Essence to be bought or sold it must be cherished protected and passed down like Generations before us have done let's be real New Orleans isn't successful because of tour for and our ability to host massive parties it's successful because of the neighborhoods the history and the people who make it special but if we keep going down this path we're going to lose all of that do you really want to trade the uniqueness of our city for some quick cash do we want to let these out of town and out of touch Dallas companies call the shots while we are left in the dark and left sitting with the consequences literally for the rest of our lives we demand the transparency in decision-making and a government that works tirelessly to uplift its residents not exploit them for short shortterm gains meel melamine and the eight adjacent adjacent parallel streets of the Lower Garden District were named after the mes of Greek mythology during the time when urban planning apparently actually meant something that's it for that time Camille uh shener says the River District misled community members in Top Golf de development would cause housing issues and harm to the community Carrie Koff says what's happening with top golf is illegal without a contract of the affordable housing deal available to the public it doesn't exist this is a corporate land grab of an historic area that belongs to the New Orleans Community please rethink this next comment is from Christa Rock The River District has proven to be dishonest many times the blatant lies surrounding Top Golf and affordable housing are very apparent they never had any intention of holding to their original Promises of a Neighborhood Housing and a grocery store now with the land swap they found loopholes to get out of the MPP neighborhood participation program they actively limit comments from the community by serving cease and assists to private citizens who voice their opinions and concerns they block comments on social media and take down websites that speak out against them not only are these actions violating First Amendment rights but it's very clear that they are up to no good I ask you all to stop this land grab build something that benefits our community go back to the original plan the only way we can further New Orleans is by supporting our communities this will only make the rich richer lastly they continue to make claims that there is a smear campaign and push conspiracy theories that there are forces against them we are concerned citizens we are not part of a smear campaign we are protecting our historic neighborhood we're not not the bad guys vote no on top golf the next comment is from Elizabeth Hyde Top Golf does not belong on the parcel it it is being allocated the Nets will trap birds and let's be honest our fire and police services barely have time for their actual jobs now they'll have to go retrieve birds from 15-story Nets the lights shine directly on and into two people's apartments and a drivers coming off the CCC I don't see how this isn't considered dangerous with our already terrible driving most importantly this parcel was supposed to be affordable housing a grocery store a gym this Swap and essentially gift to top to Top Golf is ridiculous and not what was presented to the neighborhood we don't need two of these types of things and five of four golf is in the area that makes much more sense also you're going to move a whole street for this my street and streets on my bike Road have been under construction and unusable for months but you're going to move a street for something no one in the neighborhood will use that caters to the convention crowd who pays for this it better not be our taxes do something for the people who will actually live here residents are tired of our needs being overlooked for the benefit of Tourism I think that's it on five minutes okay thank you um five minutes for support we've got the first comment is from Anthony yochi uh representing let's see key real estate company dear council members key real estate company wholeheartedly supports the proposed ordinance for the acquisition of a portion of square RP 6X slots 6A and 6B we firmly believe this ordinance signifies a vital step forward in infrastructure improvements and sets the stage to drive Community Development we urge the city council to approve this ordinance promptly recognizing its potential to drive economic growth and create a more vibrant and accessible City Chris bar uh Barry with the Louisiana music and Heritage experience says Dear council members my name is Chris Barry I'm the board chair of Louisiana music and Heritage experience which I'll refer to as the experience thank you all very much for your amazing significant amazingly significant support of the experiences developing Museum to help the story of Louisiana music from Congo Square until today with your support the experience has now been able to manifest support at the state level the experience is in support of the ordinance and respectfully requests your vote in favor the experience um is a proposed tenant in the River District development we in our first in class Consulting team across multiple disciplin disciplines believe the River District as a whole will have a substantial cultural and economic impact on our community serving as an engine to promote our future the ordinance in question will allow for several pieces of the development to progress and operate in sync with the experience's creation the experience will benefit the city with over 700,000 visitors per year $150 million per year in Economic Development 234 jobs paying $60,000 per year um on average with benefits and worldwide recognition of our culture and music it's Key to Our Success to be located at the foot of the River District development next to the convention center and an interal integral part of the River District The Experience requests that you vote in favor of this ordinance the next comment is from Douglas Stokes he says the city's in dire need of new development this land swap which paves the way for the entire River District represents one major increases in property and sales tax revenue two per perent jobs three increased competitiveness of our convention center and four a phase one project backed by a large publicly traded company which requires zero public subsidy I ask the city council to consider the alternative to the River District vacant undeveloped land offering no ADV valorum taxes and no benefit to the city how is that better than a develop fully developed Community with affordable housing retention of a major employer entertainment Etc the next comment is from Emily Kramer who says I support the top golf development and therefore support the land swap in order to accomplish said development uh Philip REO says I'm in support of the development of the top Gulf development in the river C in the River City District the project is vital to the development of that area and the creation of jobs for the community Randall A Smith says um dear members of of the council I'm writing to express my enthusiastic support for the motion introduced by council member Harris regarding the proposed development of the River District the introduction of top golf to the New Orleans Market Promises to invigorate the local economy by revitalizing a long vacant property in a dynamic and Forward Thinking manner this development is a once thriving now underutilized area um could be transformative for our city like many residents I'm eager for the new opportunities that this project will bring including job creation and increased tax revenue in a community where poverty has been a persistent challenge the prospect of approximately 400 well-paying jobs for Top Golf is expected uh to generate is particularly encouraging moreover top golf's strategic location near the moral Convention Center enhances new orleans's appeal as a destination for conventioneers this coupled with the ongoing Renovations at the convention center positions our city as an even more enticing option for tourists and business Travelers alike at a time when cities across the American South are experiencing renewal and revitalization New Orleans has seen little in the way of new construction with many noting that the only construction cranes they see in our Skyline are buildings new jail facilities the development of the River District represents a much needed injection of Vitality we have already witnessed the transformative impact of World War II museum expansion which has established a vibrant Museum District and become a new Crown Jewel of our city it's my sincere hope that we seize the opportunity before us to continue our City's progress and renewal supporting the proposed Top Golf development in the River District is a step towards a brighter more prosperous future for New Orleans and its residents get all right um council member Maro thank you um so uh I appreciate everyone's comments today um particularly the comments of the of the neighbors um I think Mr Mr Ryan Miss Pellerin you all certainly um bring up uh some good points uh regarding uh the project as a whole there have been some some comments about the project as a whole but I just want to make it U clear to everyone about what is before us today so what is before us today isn't really dealing with the with the project as as a whole or other aspects of the project what's before us today is uh the the land Swap and whether what's required for a land swap between two public entities if those requirements are being met I can tell you that about two weeks ago I did not think that those requirements were being met because one of the Constitutional mandates in uh having two public entity swap land is that each parcel of land that is being exchanged needs to be comparable in in value so since that time I had requested a a an evaluation of the parcels by an appraiser and that did come back and the appraisers are um steel Benton malanson and Associates that did show that both Parcels are comparable so as I look at what is before us today it does meet um the requirements but that is not to say that there are not you know potentially other issues with this proposal as a whole the project as a whole I've mentioned some of the previous issues um that still need to be worked on and I am hoping that we do have as a council um and I've spoken about this publicly as well a reset with the development team to to work more collaboratively uh together as this as this moves forward but once again before us today is really a very technical matter similar to what we had you know roughly two weeks AO go with the Duncan Plaza exchange that wasn't about whether or not you support uh potential new Civic complex or whatever development could come there it's whether that particular instrument before us met the criteria and it did two weeks ago with Duncan Plaza and it does today thank you any other council members wish to speak all right let me just wrap this bit up by um saying this um I believe that the River District is going to be transforming in a positive way I believe that bringing together retail along with 900 units of new housing along the riverfront which has sat bow for 30 years 450 of which will be affordable in Workforce will be transformative I believe that the investors who represent a diverse team we don't deny any of that this is about top I believe that the in you you need to be in order we allowed you to speak you need to be in order thank you I believe that the diverse team represented by the developers are doing their best to try to build a new development again along a Riverfront that has sat empty for years and for that reason I've supported rdna I've supported this development and as council member Mareno said this is a technical vote and so with that I'm going to move as amended seconded by council member green all in favor five y one nay thank [Laughter] you people over this is an illustration exactly of why this doesn't work this is our first time to speak in public about this Andrew it actually is not your first time speaking in public about this so don't act like it [Music] is of you council members we're now going to go back to page 12 we have

numbers delete the figure 69 69 m410 144 and replaced with 69,4 110,111 43 that is the amendment thank you madam clerk um the primary focus of this amendment is to award sujan waterboard the $8 million that we discussed here during Tuesday's meeting for the substation I also want to take this opportunity to do something a little bit different which is to comment on some pending legislation at the state I know some of my colleagues may want to weigh in as well um as I read hb4 9 41 it is 100% a takeover of su and waterboard let's just look at the language as my law school Professor used to urge me to do it says part one The reformative Entity for New Orleans panel referred to in the section as panel is hereby created here's the operative language to assume the responsibilities of the new oral and sewage and water board that ladies and gentlemen is a takeover the next part part 2 A the public water system the public sewage system and the public drainage system of the City of New Orleans shall be constructed controlled maintained and operated by the panel that is a takeover next line Part B under part two the panel May exercise any and all powers and duties granted to the board by or under Louisiana law that is also a takeover I say all this because we have been very clear as a council that the thing that we are concerned about the most is that we have all of the accountability but little of the authority and we are constantly being called upon to fund projects for Su and water board to make sure the residents have clean drinking water power that works and that there aren't wild sewer breaks as well I will say this I am going to vote for the $8 million right now and I know that the $13 million is supposed to come later but if there is a vote by the state to take over and take away the Su and water board completely as is proposed in this bill that 13 million I will have grave reservations forwarding given the fact that the city will no longer have any control whatsoever I know the board is lit up before we vote council member morale council member Thomas thank you um I Echo many of my colleague sentiments but I want to be even more specific when you look at the Takeover proposed by the task force the actual takeover by the task force is less all-encompassing than what is proposed in this bill this bill basically just replaces the sewer Engine waterboard with all the powers and responsibilities it has with the state appointed panel that is not a recovery District that's a step Beyond a recovery District it's just a replacement board with State officials but I want to go one step further there is an emphasis throughout this legislation on having an essentially an accounting of past judgments there's specific language in there that talks about how uh essentially there'll be an audit going to see what all the judgments are pending against the New Orleans se waterboard this gives me grave concern and let me tell you why the New Orleans sewage and water board and the City of New Orleans both have an incredible backlog of past due judgments and this is a problem that exists in both bodies that must be resolved in a holistic way councilman juso has been on a point of this talking about potentially Bond sales and the like to create a new sewage and water board a state board that is getting an itemized list of past judgments with ultimate authority to do anything that it seeks to do with the authority vested in it seems to State there will be a particular effort to pay P due judgments that is not normally a bad thing if you have a holistic solution to paying P due judgments however the only revenue of the New Orleans sewage and water board is rates and millages that's it and those rates and millages go towards the ongoing operations of the New Orleans sewage and water board when the obligations exceed those rates and millages you see things like today where they go we need $8 million of $21 million to get this substation up which is a priority for this Council and for citizens to not flood I Echo what council member juso already said said in that it does not make sense for this Council to obligate itself to give 13 million more do to a state panel that will be fixated on settling past judgments when that 13 million is to build a substation it does not I do not want to deemphasize the fact judgment should be paid but right now it's about drainage preventing flooding and protecting the livelihood in the lives of people in the City of New Orleans you cannot prioritize paying past judgments off of protecting businesses and lives and should this panel ever come into existence we could never trust them with 13 million dollar without based upon what's in front of us that they will in fact prioritize lives overpass judgments so I Echo uh the the Chairman's statements I support everything he's saying and what's really disheartening in this conversation is that when we have bills like Senator Harris's and representative hil's where everyone on the state and local level have come together to focus on what we agree on you have this outlier bill that simply exists to create Discord and conflict because I have yet to find anyone other than the author and maybe the co-author that support this bill of the people that have been having the arguments the fights the disagreements and the settlements on the future of sewage and waterboard none of them want this it's a dangerous distraction and it I call upon the legislature I call upon the author to take this off the table so we can focus on the things of which there is agreement thank you thank you very much council member Thomas uh first of all I want to thank council member uh jerusa for his comments and I can say it in my calm voice uh this issue in the matter of billing is really just really a red herring and for the media and the Press here what we need the state to be is a predator it's a partner uh not a predator if the state wants to work with the City of New Orleans it would be better served if that if they would work with us to improve infrastructure to improve our standing in this community and then for folk if they didn't know and the Press isn't going to report this for for for the reporters who are here the American Association of Civil Society of civil engineers gives the state a D in terms of how they take care of and deal with our infrastructure so so why would you give a d student in a system why would you give a state that fails in most infrastructure categories uh members of the press well probably because coun J the reason why they focus on the take to over that's probably the most the sexiest thing not to talk about how a state that fails in its own infrastructure with 15% of the state's water systems that are actually failing they don't tell you that Sean Wilson's own report about the inability to have resources to take take care of our infrastructure they won't tell you that yeah we want the state's help yeah we want to partner with the St with the with the state but I think it would be better served that if the the state would work hard to improve its standing as it relates to its infrastructure improve its standing as it relates to its systems improve its standing as it relates to its water systems before it starts taking on systems and other communities that actually Faire better in the rating than theirs and that's not because I say it that's because if you look at the grading system in America thank you thank you council member Thomas council member Green in councilman Thomas's and my district there are right now Three Bridges out the seab brook Bridge the AL manaster Bridge which is controlled by a state agency and also the chef Pass Bridge which is just exclusively and in and councilman um Thomas's agency I mean um district there is raw sewage flowing into the backs of yards in St Tam Parish brides are actually in in your District I cross right on the line right on the line well the Alman for example it goes right down the line the bottom line is is that very near to my district and in my district and very near to councilman Thomas's District but also in his district there are three Bridges out right now which are a problem because they're controlled by the state of Louisiana or an agency of the state of Louisiana it's an example of the difficulty in controlling infrastructure um needs we also have raw sewage flowing into St Tam Parish ditches we also have rate increases that have been announced in Jefferson Parish of 20 years years for what infrastructure improvements because of the crumbling infrastructure there's nothing inherently wrong with New Orleans that we can't get things done that other people have done what we ignore sometimes is the fact that there are problems throughout our state I have not heard yet with all of these proposals as to the funding source that's going to make available the millions and it may be a billion dollars that is needed to address crumbling pipes under our street and to get the pumping capacity raised and other issues like that it is fair for us to ask since we're being put on the spot as regulators and we are not really Regulators there the sewage and water boo was created by the state of Louisiana and is governed by mostly state law it's fair for us to ask well if we were going to support something like this just say maybe in support of our rate payers here what are you going to do to make money or to make money available for these projects that need to be done so that we can achieve efficiencies the political thought of a takeover the language the rhetoric that's being used is not sat it's not satisfying a great concern what is going to change that makes resources available we've been asked as a city council to be in charge of whether or not we're going to increase rates or we going to let them stay the same and obviously in the midst of all of the challenges we've done the things that our citizens have asked for keep rate stable until we get our situations together relative to billing and stopping some of the flooding I think that the city council has done a job a job that is very honestly a Yan's job in working with our citizens and staying in contact with them helping to resolve some of these issues the main thing that I want to say is the rhetoric relative to State takeover and not talking about the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed for infrastructure has got to stop the city council is willing to meet with anyone who wants to talk to us about reasonable me measures to enhance the sewage and water board but I hope that the media and our citizens will ask the questions of the state that need to be asked in C in um the task force report it suggested measures of quote unquote takeover but there was a suggestion that there needs to be a look at rate payers in terms of where the resources are going to come from to make these changes that have to be made keep those things in mind where's the money going to come from if there even were a takeover to get things like the substation done and the infrastructure work done that needs to be done councilor member juso just in in 30 seconds to put Layman's concept uh uh terms and translation on what you're saying uh you can put lipstick on a pig but you still can't make us believe it's Beyonce Council memoral you want to come back after that all right all right I'm going to I'm going to move on just the amendment c number oh sorry you told me before we vote Yes Madam clerk we me to make one little correction to how was right in in the um amendment number six on page five line 74 new line numbers delete the figure 39,6 18678 3 and replaced with 39 m686 784 thank you madam Clark for that clarification I've moved seconded by council member green members please V your machines I think I need one more no you got five we got five I thought we had six what we have six people here but there's six mine didn't come up so yay okay council member green J all right um Mr bernside wants to make a comment let him do that the only thing I want to stress is if anybody has any questions Kyle is here to answer them this capital budget is not only representative of what the administration wanted but all of our work collectively about needs that people presented in their districts and so I want to thank each of my colleagues to my right and I got that right this time council member Morel I know my right from my left that um who who really worked hard to make sure that they asked for specific items for their districts and that those items are about to be included in what we're going to vote on Mr Burnside I have a strange request council person Thomas may I have one minute of personal privilege to talk about suage and water board before I start talking about a actual calendar number 34612 you know you know we got nine council members you're the eth I'll give you anything you need thank you very much sir I won't to ask who the ninth is for one minute on sewage and waterboard I want to mention a couple things one of which is I agree with councilman Thomas with regards to the Water Systems throughout the state there was a newspaper article several years ago pointing out that the entire state is full of particularly small towns that just don't have functioning Water Systems anymore and we won't mention Jackson Mississippi because it's not in Louisiana next I I want to mention that I actually find myself in agreement with councilman green uh the idea that we're going fix this uh requires us to discuss publicly revenue streams where is it going to come from who's going to pay for it and how does that look um I know that puts me in a very embarrassing position I'm going to turn red here in a moment uh as far as the rest of it uh I'm a little more evil than you are I believe in the Chinese curse if you have an enemy give him what he asked for so I think shoes up my one minute on the suian waterboard uh as far as calendar number 34612 um so I'm going to rely on my memory which uh is probably going to embarrass me but I did read this a while ago and if I remember correctly which I may not and can be corrected it's shifting around like $109 million plus or minus you know 10 million here or there which really uh makes my life difficult because I I try to to follow kind of sort of like where the money goes because allegedly the Money Matters and it would be really good at some point if the council would ask the administration for an end ofe budget spent report so at the very beginning of the year we go through the politics and the anguish of figuring out a budget and people come in here and get depressed because they did not get money for their favorite whatever and then they go home and they cry and then in the midst of the year there's all kinds of budget reasons to change things sometimes we get more Revenue than we thought sometimes we get less Revenue than we thought sometimes we have to buy a substation whatever but stuff changes and sometimes it changes significantly so it would be really good to have an end-year report which the city does generate an end year report for the State Legislative auditor and which I do read but it's in a completely different format where everything's done by fund number instead of by Department budget and so it's more and more difficult for me to keep track of wha the hell is going on when you got $109 million being shifted left and right and $8 million tossed in for a substation like it doesn't matter because some people only get an $8 million budget and we come back to scrounging under coues to find funding for Nord and uh since I don't own a couch there's no money there thank you very much thank you Mr Burnside all right I've moved for approval seconded by council member King 6 we're now going to go to the bottom of page 30 thank call audits calendar number 34616 by council members juso Moreno Morel Harris and Thomas and ordinance to codify the city's net 30 obligation to its vendors and contractors for the payment of all Undisputed amounts within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice to amend and reordain section 2- 551 of the city code to require City departments to appear before Council to discuss the reports detailing all outstanding vendor invoices required therein and otherwise to provide respect there to thank you madam clerk I just want to thank council members Moreno Morel Harris and Thomas for co-sponsoring this all this is making uh the department who is responsible for paying a vendor come to the next council meeting if that vendor has not been paid within 30 days I think we're all tired of hearing about vendors not being timely paid our vendors are our partners and I want to make sure that we're treating them like our partners and I view this as a way to make that happen so I'm going to move for approval seconded by council member Harris council member juso I don't know if I'm I don't know if I missed that one but I would certainly Ser sponsor well uh why don't we put everybody on it unless there's any OB I don't know if there was something s out that it's we're happy to have you thank you all seven Y no Nays thank you we're now going to go to the regular order of the agenda on page 16 we have a legislative group in hdlc appeal of Ron loel governmental Affairs lead consultant Zach Smith consultant and design requesting to appeal the historic district landmarks Commission hdlc decision of denial of the application for demolition of the building by raising the building for located Building located at 1517 Broadway Street and on top of page 17 is the motion m241 1227 by council member juso granting the applicants request for demolition for the property located at 1517 Broadway Street thank you Miss Burke thank you 1517 Broadway is an intact craftsman style raised basement located in the Uptown partial control demolition only local historic district the area is known for its handsome cohesive assemblage of craftsman style Bungalows race basement Bungalows and Mediterranean Revival style duplexes the construction of an additional ground store ground floor story distorts the perception of the historic building type while creating an anomalous acronis building that is neither this nor that doing so ultimately permanently dilutes and destroys the authenticity and integrity of the district specifically and ultimately the city at large FEMA funding allows for the applicant to abandon the ground floor to its original use as flood protection and construction of additions to recoup the ab abandoned square footage hdlc recommends this path as it follows for the goals of both sustainability and historic preservation if the building is to be elevated hdlc recommends that the ground floor continue to be treated architecturally as a basement story in order for it to maintain the style and character of a raised baseman Craftsman Bungalow the Florida ceiling height could be reduced from 9 ft High to 8 ft High and the ground floor entrance Door relocated from the front elevation this would result in a design that retains the character and quality of the historic district at their meeting of February 7th 2024 the commission reviewed the proposal as the applicant was uninterested in revising the proposal or working with the commission they voted unanimously to deny the application thank you very much before I get to my comments I have two comment cards here but I think they were related to the consent agenda but let me just call the names really quickly Joshua tanon Bal not here hakee Morad also not here Mr Smith good afternoon Council Zach Smith on behalf of the owner 1000 South normany Francis I really appreciate your support today uh this is a project utilizing state and federal Grant Monies to elevate properties and make our city more resilient uh this property owner specifically has been impacted with repeated flooding over the last couple years so we really appreciate your support today thank you thank you very much um as Mr Smith just alluded to I understand that there are historic guidelines but we live in a place where there is climate change and flooding and I would note that not three blocks away from here we're getting inundated sorry for the pun about people's complaints with flooding and so these owners are requesting to elevate the property pursu to a FEMA flood Grant I feel like that puts us in a very difficult position when somebody says they are flooding you have Federal funds available to help them avoid flooding and then to say no we're not going to Grant you the ability to raise your house even though you file a federal mandated process and are getting money from the federal government to help deal with with a real crisis this is also a Homestead exemp Property the project has support from direct neighbors no oppositions the owners have agreed to a deed restriction as well against short-term rentals uh with that I've moved for approval of m241 127 and to Grant the appeal second by council member Harris six thank you at the bottom of the page we have a legislative group in hdlc appeal of Alvin C me the thir law office of Shear Gardner Kake Hill richer Klein and Hilbert LLC requesting to appeal the historic district landmarks commission decision of denial of the application for demolition of a contributing rated raised basement two family building to grade for property located at 252 Jefferson Avenue we have motion m241 1228 by council member juso granted the applicant's request for demolition for a property located at 252 Jefferson Avenue thank you madam clerk Miss Burk FMA survey Research indicates the original raised basement Cottage was constructed from 1920 to 1930 however it first appears on the first on the 1951 fire Insurance map at some points in the 20th century the front porch was enclosed as evidenced by the remaining craftsman style rafter Tales at the ridge line 25 O2 Jefferson Avenue is a book end of an entirely intact block of raised Cottages that are indicative of the era in which they were constructed hdlc staff conducted interior and exterior uh inspection and found the building to be in fair condition Foundation settlement is common for a building of this age and style though the condition should be addressed through Shoring and leveling it does not appear to be an imminent Hazard given the fair condition of this building envelope rehabilitating it is certainly feasible for the four mentioned reasons staff recommended denial of demolition to grade this building could easily be restored to its original appearance that includes a generous front porch and stair at their meeting of February 7th 20124 commission voted unanimously to deny the demolition of the entire building thank you all right we do have several comment cards here and I thank you all for your patience um Miss Johnson is an position do you want to speak Susan Johnson 2822 leage Street historic New Orleans neighborhoods I'm not paid to be here this appeal should be denied not granted developer blue Orleans claim claims deterioration as the reason for Demolition and he's owned the house himself for 11 years on the other hand hdlc inspectors say subsidence is just normal are we really supposed to believe that the problem is worse than it is and therefore worthy of Demolition and then forgive him for not maintaining it himself the house himself and then give him a prize by letting him tear it down all of this makes no sense and must be wrong blue Orleans does not apply for work permits look at their other properties doesn't hasn't applied for work permits in 11 years of ownership at 252 Jefferson not at 2724 Valance which he's just sold not a 2720 Valance now on the market as a brand new renovation no work permits no City inspection no certificate of occupancy for any of these buildings safety and permits in addition safety and permits confirm by email that the owner's commercial property at 4917 fet has no CEO that they can document 30 seconds why don't these violations with their potential safety concerns have a bearing on your decision you can't blame code enforcement safety and permits for not enfor forcing the rules and then you just give these people a pass it doesn't make sense it's happening as a tendance as a tendency and I'm putting it on the record I oppose this overturning of the hdlc decision appeal yet again thank you Miss Johnson all right Mary Colin hi hi thanks for having me good after I've known Michael for a long time through the the process of him buying real estate and I wanted to emphasize that he's contributed tremendously to the fet neighborhood he was one of the first people that went in there and bought property renovated it held it for rentals so to maintain you know uh housing in the area for the locals um also a lot of what he's done has also created um revitalization of fret Street itself it's a now it's a commercially vibrant area completely different than it was 12 years ago um let's see I think his idea to demo 2502 Jefferson makes sense I've been inside the house I've seen the um the the slab and I think the highest and best use of that property would to be build a new house and his intent is to make make it architecturally relevant with um you know more efficient use and mechan mechanics sorry um I don't so basically that's what I wanted to emphasize is that he's very committed to the community he has done a lot of Renovations and held on to them uh he went into the Irish Channel back in 2010 and and you know renovated some houses in there where there was nothing going on um let's see so I say I I am for this uh permit thank you very much thank you all right I'm I'm going to butcher your name is it Ola inav I apologize in advance and please please correct me on how to say your name Alesia yanovich there you go thank you honorable Council I'm here in favor um Michael of blor who is a builder who helped developed and Elevate the fet and Jefferson neighborhoods um in full respect to preservation of the beautiful New Orleans traditional architecture its Bri vibrant color and energy for over 15 years helping these neighborhoods become a staple that it is I live in one of the homes that he has built on 4916 South Robertson and my neighbors live across the street I live with my little daughter 5 years old and she plays with the girl across the street and we enjoy the homes he has built he's buil them safe he's buil them with quality and their efficient homes while they look and feel like beautiful traditional elegant New Orleans homes so I'm not bothered by constant renovation and upgrade expenses leagues and damages instead of budgeting for um annual repairs on the home I can budget for my daughter um experience education and bettering her future while we better the future of the neighborhood that we all live live in I hope the new home will Elevate the neighborhood even more becomes a safe haven for a family that can enjoy it while living in a constantly elevated and safe neighborhood thank you for the opportunity to share in good spirits and helping the neighborhood Elevate only adding to a staple that New Orleans is today thank you thank you very much Mark Thomas good afternoon council members my name is Mark Thomas I'm a former professor of architecture at School of Architecture at Tulane and I'm also a landscape architect I live in one of the houses that Michael built it's very fine quality the attention to detail is amazing and I happen to know Michael personally from having been his professor at tane and I think that Michael is a person that is a rare person who really does want to do the right thing I've seen him uh spend money that he didn't need to spend to do the right thing in so many cases and uh I believe that in this case the house is not of any great AR listen this I'm a preservationist okay I don't believe in tearing down buildings unless they have to be torn down this doesn't have to be torn down but it should be torn down because it's going to be replaced with a fine piece of architecture that the City of New Orleans uh will be proud of and let me tell you um just because the building is there it doesn't mean that it's always feasible to renovate just because the the uh the HDL see whom I used to advise by the way when I worked for the Planning Commission in the 80s um we used to um I mean they used to um uh uh just deny demolitions for uh for for for for what am I trying to say here for for situations that probably didn't deserve it in this case I do believe that this demolation this demolition will be uh for the better of the neighborhood I live in the neighborhood I live three blocks from here um the neighborhood has been transformed over the last five or six or seven years uh from from empty and derel houses to uh houses that are renovated many of of which Michael has done so I U urge you to consider the uh the uh overturn of the uh hlc's recommendation uh for uh for denial of the demolition so thank you very much thank you Al and then we'll end with Meb good afternoon Alvin Meer 909 poetress I'm an attorney with Sher Garner and I'm representing the owner I urge you to uh Grant this appeal the uh building that we're looking at uh the historic Integrity of it has been significantly altered over the years over the last 100 years there've been many changes it's no longer historically significant uh in order to renovate it it's not feasible not economical however if we build a new building we'll build a building that is more in tune with the neighborhood code compliant energy efficient and safe uh also the uh what the owner is planning to do is it's going to be a building for uh single family residential for sale so I urge you to uh support this uh uh appeal thank you thank you very much all right Mr Burnside Michael oric Burnside 2215 Felicity um I would suggest that Michael look at the 1600 block of Reverend John rafhael Jr way there are two houses there that are in much worse shape than that and uh perhaps he could renovate them and make money it's unfortunate when good people do bad things because obviously you look at good people and you go well you're good people you know your family members your church members your people that I went to school with you're good people so we let you get away with bad stuff because why else would we not right we don't hold family members accountable my neighborhood suffers heroin addicts it suff heroin addicts that are family members a gentleman whose street name is Ducky has a mother lives nearby she collects a disability check Ducky's on the street but he's not homeless he goes home at night he leaves home well washed and in clean clothes he doesn't stay that way so how do you hold good people accountable for bad actions Susan Johnson did her research she went back and she said hey we're a city that says you're supposed to do a person didn't do a we're a city that's supposed to do B didn't do B didn't do c either he may be an incredibly good human being who does really good work and he may find the city very frustrating to interact with and he may have good witness as to why he did not follow the rules but nonetheless he didn't follow them because Susan Johnson's a competent human being and she's not a liar and she stood here and told you this man broke the rules so we are in a city where either breaking rules has conse consquences or it doesn't thank you all right um I've moved for approval let me just say it's important to note that as this house stands it's an amalgamation of many different historical elements there is no single identified feature there are very few left uh historical details on this house this was not a unanimous vote at hdlc with Commissioners Lupin and Bressler uh moving to allow the demolition the owner as I did the last one will remain a single family home with a deed restriction for short-term rentals and you've heard all of the people in support uh so I've moved for approval they have a second second by council member Harris five Y no NS thank you council members we're now going to go to page 29 we have a legislative grouping zoning docket 2524 topcap Enterprises LLC requesting an amendment to ordinance number 19761 MCS zoning

Frenchman Street the recommendation of the City Planning Commission being for approval subject to eight provisors we have motion M24 131 by council member King approving the applicants request on zoning docket number 2524 for the property located at 621 through 623 Frenchman Street subject to eight provisors clerk CPC the FL this is a application affecting the spotted cat on uh 621 Frenchman Street to allow it to uh expand uh it's currently governed by an approval dating to 2000 that allowed the bar but uh limited it only to the structures first floor the current proposal is to demolish a two-story apartment at the rear of the site and conduct uh or rather construct an addition to expand the bar it would result in new ground level Courtyard space repurposing of existing second floor storage space into seating space and the addition of new back of house space The Proposal is generally consistent with the role of the Frenchman Street arts and culture overlay District which seeks to support ENT entertainment uses at the Planning Commission meeting there were several speakers in support and none in opposition and so the Planning Commission recommends pral thank you thank you Mr Crow we have two uh cards that are in support Mr Chris Young and Mr Bill of the spider cat uh do we have any online comments we have one online comment okay this is from Kip holler with the faberg Marin Improvement Association he says fmia is in support of approving the applicants request and Zoning docka 2524 for the property located at 6123 Frenchman Street subject to the Proviso the following modifications provisor one shall be changed to increase the required amount of contract off street parking to 12 parking spaces to serve uh the use 10 spaces were provided for in the original conditional use in 2000 with the expansion of the footprint of the building it's only natural that the amount of required parking be increased as well Proviso 7 should be changed from um quote the bar shall operate across the full footprint of the site end quote to instead read the bar shall be permitted to operate across the full footprint of the site the current language suggests a requirement for the bar to operate across the full footprint instead of granting permission for them to be able to do so should they so choose that's it for the comments thank you at this time make a motion to adopt second by council member Morel six Y no seven Y no n thank youwe're now going back to page 18 we have a leg lative group and the hdlc appeal of 27 Nukem Boulevard has been withdrawn for the applicants request we have motion m241 1229 has been withdrawn so we're now on top of page 19 the hdlc appeal of 2430 nor rampo Street has been deferred to April 18th at the bottom of the page a legislative grouping the hdlc appeal of David O'Reilly requesting to appeal the historic district Landmark commission's decision of denile of the application for retention of the fence and gate at the front of the building for property located at 518 South Rampart Street motion m241 1223 by council member Harris approving the applicant's request for the property located at 518 South rampa Street Elanor will you brief us on hlc report yes the violation for the installation of the gate and fence at the front of the building was first cited in January of 2016 and a permit was applied for to correct those violations in April of 2017 however that permit expired due to inactivity and the fence and gate were never removed they do not meet the hdlc guidelines as they specifically State we do not permit fencing located on porches Stoops or stairs further the fencing is a contextual to the building and antithetical to its original design this building was originally a bank that would have had been open to the public and installing fencing between the columns creates an unwelcoming defensive condition because of these reasons staff recommended denial of the application at their

ordinance calendar number [Music] Orleans to enter into a Cooperative Endeavor agreement between the City of New Orleans and the French Market Corporation for the design and construction of improvements to the upper paba building including the repair and replacement of the HVAC system related electrical and mechanical systems Courtyards windows facades and other exterior and interior repairs as set forth as exhibit a and otherwise to provide with respect th to so if my memory is true we're going to spend 8 million bucks the newspaper said 10 million bucks fixing up the over pableo it's the 64 units we can all do the math if we want to but we also spent $8 million today on the uh Su and water board and where we could spend $10 million if we found or $8 million if we found under a couch but apparently that's not going to happen at this second so money comes money goes but the bottom line is what do we get in exchange and the question becomes do we value what we get in exchange and I for one do not value owning the upper Pento because it is not for poor people it is not subsidizing people to stay off the street it is for rich people to come into the City and enjoy the city and depart the city and as such they should own the building and they should pay taxes on it it and they should pay for the maintenance and they should pay to take care of it and I shouldn't have to be involved in it and I shouldn't have to care if the mayor is there or not this thing is intruded into the public sphere and quite frankly it should be excluded from the public sphere and sent off to the private sphere and it should be owned by some nice private corporation that will maximize its return on its investment and maybe make a small donation to some homeless fund or something thank you motion to adopt second by council member Jerusa [Music] six waiting on uh is this a TCA motion because if we voted on TCA motion earlier I was supposed to recuse myself what this
