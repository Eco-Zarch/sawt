successful morning I want to thank our panelist today for being willing to share the information that you have and your passion for wanting to help people to heal people and to help people move forward in great health I want to tell you that today my remarks are very simple we lose too many people to prostate cancer and the Colin cancer coloror related um illness and disease and the more that we talk about it the more I think people will be willing to do the screening that is necessary the testing that is necessary and you by being here today may help someone but you certainly already because I've already gotten phone calls from people who just appreciate the fact that professionals such as yourself are coming to talk about a subject that we don't talk about enough we need to talk about more and if we talked about more it could save lives before we move forward with your presentations which will start with Dr McKenna I'd like to ask councilman Freddy King if he will introduce a special guest who has a special gift for all of us today thank you council member green it is it is my great pleasure to introduce Abigail Marie King she is going to start the uh the day off with a musical note so we're going to do what we practice at home coming from Al jar Louisiana I present to you Abigail Marie King all right [Applause] [Music] he [Music] all right thank you Abigail and

Liliana and she's being held by the original Mrs King meline King let's give them a round of applause the beautiful family thank you thank you Abigail for starting us off in that um very very worthy way not at all I'm going to turned over to Dr McKinna and um for a little while and I appreciate I Al I will say this I appreciate the members of the council for allowing the three orders of business today to be dedicated to such an important subject matter certainly health coloral and um and prostate cancer we know the devastating effect that it has on our communities and even before we move forward I want to thank um Miss Lena Stewart and also my um legislative director attorney Monique green not related also um just got to always make that clear um at the end of the day their work and the work of the staff members and councilman Thomas's office and in my office and the contribution that other council members made is greatly appreciated this is a subject that is near and dear to my heart I think that everybody probably knows someone who is either suffered from prostate or colon cancer or passed away from it the more we can talk about it the better so I want to thank everyone who made today Poss possible so Dr McKenna why don't you start us off please well I'm certainly thank the city council for uh getting us here today to talk about the uh these two serious diseases which uh certainly ravaged uh the country and and internationally for that matter um prostate cancer of course is the most common uh cancer in men and um color rectal cancer um is in the top three or four uh in both men and women uh when you look at the statistics uh surrounding it both of these CA cancers are slow growing and give us an opportunity to diagnose them early if we do the proper screening um so that we could these are two cancers while very prevalent give us a chance to improve survival rates with early detection because there are the two of the uh cancers where early detection methods are available to us and certainly in cancer the most important thing is early detection and your outcomes are are always better when you can uh find cancer early and then use one of the myriads of treatment that have evolved over the years in both of these cancers as a matter of fact um the treatments range from very simple observation to radical surgery and it is important to catch it early so you can make those kinds of appropriate decisions as to which course may be better for you so uh the distinguished panel members here uh probably have uh more information uh uh than I do uh certainly I've spent 40 years as a surgeon and have had tremendous clinical experience with not prostate cancer but colon cancer um so uh I think that uh the more you talk about it the more awareness that we can bring the more people understand that we can intervene at earlier stages and the earliest intervention is the best treatment so with all of saying all of that and with all of that in mind I will turn over the uh uh microphone to Dr Dumas since is to my left okay um thank you um build building on what Dr McKenna said early detection is key um prostate cancer coloral cancer very very slowly growing cancers in in the big picture of of cancer um you can detect those early and you can make a difference um there's a reason why if you have a colonoscopy and it looks good they may tell you come back in 10 years years or five years it's going to take that long for something to come up that's going to be of significance problem comes when you don't get that screening you're 45 you're going to think about it later you're 50 you know you're going to think about it later maybe you get busy at 52 or 53 um you start having problems at 54 and and we see this a lot and now you're afraid because I know I've been having some issues I'm um an amazing amount of people are afraid to go to the doctor because they don't want to hear what's going on U but uh the ostrich theory of of medicine and Healthcare will never work you can't bury your head in the sand and pretend that it doesn't exist um we run into a little a little bit more um difficulty um our clinics are primarily on the West Bank and primarily in the African-American community and we if you're if you're going to look at prostate cancer even coloral cancer and and I'm I'm not going to have all the statistics but we have a ton of smart people up here who are going to have those statistics for you um on the ground um we do still have trouble with with screenings um the stigma of screening um especially with colar Rector cancer we fight through that all the time different methods that you can use to screen for colar Rector cancer I still think that colonoscopy is going to be the best method um we we consider that more cancer prevention because if you see aop you see anything you can snip it off your chances of cancer are going to be a lot less um but we also realize that there going to be a certain group of of a percentage of patients who are not going to do a colonoscopy so the recommendations have shifted a little bit um do the test that the patient's going to do so that's that's what you want to do now if I can't convince you to get a colonoscopy maybe I can convince you to do a cola guard if I can't convince you to do that maybe you can do a stool study um and I'm going to bother you until you do I'm going to give you the right of first refusal every single time I see you until you decide that it's important enough um to actually get done because all of us up here can we went to the same schools we know the same medicine we can write the same prescriptions that's that's not the trick the trick is convincing people that what you're telling them is important enough for them to actually do um and that's where you're going to have to reach people um individually we try to figure out how to do that on a CommunityWide level but that's going to be a bit more difficult you know we try to get one person that person brings someone else in you tell your brother you tell tell your uncle and your auntie and they're going to trust you probably more than they trust me and if you say it's okay then it's then it's going to be fine um especially with prostate cancer we know that in in the African-American Community the prevalence is probably twice as much and more lethal um so I I do screen for that I know the recommendation is to have a discussion with your patients I will discuss it briefly as not really uh do you want it or not it's more where when we get your laps I'm going to send that in with you and um that's how we've been able to get our screen rates up and I've probably said enough I'm I'm going to defer to anybody else that wants to um to jump in but in the big picture both cancers are very preventable they are easily detectable the screenings are are painless by what anybody thinks um and two of the few cancers that we can actually make a big difference if you catch them early so there's no reason that our mortality rates our cancer rates should be that high for those two particular um diseases thank you Dr Griggs good morning uh so let me get the uh the doctor stuff out of the way I just had an epipal moment uh the stats are one in eight men uh in the United States will be one in seven uh 1.7 uh will be diagnosed with uh uh Prost point7 for black men7 for black men and then for color rectal cancer it's one in 23 for men and one in 25 for women um I I had a moment and I have to stop myself from getting emotional because I just realized in the back sitting here it was actually 10 years ago to the month that I came in here with my hula hoops talking about my get checked get fit get moving and I went on a underwear exam Crusade across the city uh at the barber shops at the churches on the radio everywhere I could and the reason it was an underwear exam is because most men when they shook my hands they were like Doc your hand's too big to be my doctor I'm not going to get that exam because I don't want the finger and I they Associated the col rectal uh cancer the colon oopy with finger so I did this thing and uh we were pretty successful but then um in the midst of it one of my best friends Danny Williams who I'd have on the radio with me um we were jogging trying to raise money for the American Heart Association and he kept having pain in the lower left quadrant of his stomach and I thought he was just you know kind of not really wanting to run CU we were at Mile 9 of 10 um kept pestering him to go to the doctor and he was 41 at the time and it turned out to be color rectal cancer and it was the size of a golf ball now he was only 41 which means he didn't fall into those lines and those parameters the the stats that I just said but he fell it fell on my doorstep and in my heart um so it was 10 years ago um that I started that campaign and I had him on the radio I did everything I possibly could but sadly it was too late um no one in his family talked about cancer he didn't know and we still don't know if he has a family history of col rectal cancer or any cancers one out of every five deaths in the United States is due to cancer so before we went to school to become drct this doctor that well I was just Eric with close friends and family and right now in my immediate circle I have five men that are EI EI either immediately post survival for prate cancer and one actively with it who's he might have just turned 40 uh another one is in his late 60s that just had it and then two doctors two my colleagues when people want me to come and be on on panels to speak about prostate cancer I usually if they're in town I try to defer to them because no one is more of an expert on your body than the amazing people in this room that have survived so it's one thing to talk about something objective and we're talking about prostate cancer and col rectal cancer and it it's it's emotional for me because the campaign continues and now I got back to help spread the word but if anyone can avoid the pain of losing a loved one to something that is truly curable by prevention and is simply a conversation with any of these colleagues or anyone any of their doctors um then I'd love to do it and I'm I'm proud to be here I I'll stop there I don't want to start crying my dad will be mad well thank you I appreciate that I appreciate that personal testimony too um so good morning again thank you Dr uh uh Mr Green for inviting us I'm I'm v f Sam I'm a colon rectal surgeon by training and so I see a lot of colon cancer patients and rectal cancer patients I've been in New Orleans a year and 4 months now I came from Arizona where I was there for 11 years and I came here as a the chair surgery here and to run uh lcmc U cancer service line I can tell you I'm just going to reframe the question a little bit more colal cancer is the third most common diagnos cancer in the United States and the second cause of cancer related death 150,000 people will be diagnosed this year with coral cancer and 50,000 of them will die okay despite that we've made significant progress in the last 30 years incidents of corector cancer in the last 30 years gone down almost 12% almost 12% the Affordable Care Act expansion of Medicaid significant L improved Early Access early screening in a recent paper we're just about to publish we actually saw that now we diagnosing cancer color cancer even earlier so people presenting an earlier stage than a later stage now I can tell you that in those 30 years or so we've seen a significant increase in cor Rector cancer in younger patients so in 12 years ago one of the papers we published actually showed that 7 almost uh 84% for rectal cancer and 64 for for colon cancer and so what does that mean and not only that there significant disparity right we see younger patients especially African American patients and Hispanic patients even being diagnosed at a much earlier stage so this if I'm sure everybody here knows the American Cancer Society uh this all this early diagnosis prompted to reduce screening age to 45 and 45 from our studies is not good enough for black men and black women we really think it should actually be lower than that because the age between 40 and 44 we see even a higher Spike of of corector cancer so we've made progress with screening better with new uh techniques then people are dying less Believe It or Not uh the incidence of that is actually trending down because of new techniques new modalities new treatment options that we have screening uh I I just want to particularly Echo what some of the other panelists have been talking about screening should be targeted it's not one siiz fitall right so coming from Arizona where we had to Target the Border areas we had to Lobby the the uh state government to provide funds for screening and a education health education is key significant impact to churches and worship places those are the places where we can actually make significant difference I can tell you moving to uh New Orleans and working at UMC nearly every patient I see of color presents with a more advanced disas what that tells me if they coming with stage four disease they just don't know when a screen they have symptoms for a long period of time they just don't even know what's going on and so screening is the key education is a key that's the only way we can actually move this needle a little bit hello hello good morning um as an emergency medicine physician um I think a lot would question I guess why I'm here but I think all would agree um at the panel here that if at the time in the emergency department that you are seeing me it is way too late um there's a common Echo and themee that is frequently you know being brought up here and that's the word of screening um screening is so important and it's pivotal um that you do so for what makes sense for you right as you've heard here there are many different methods of screening um there are blood tests there are physical exams and you can work with your provider um to figure out what is the best method for you to get to the best Optimal Health um the public health provider in me um as an employee of the health department um is saddened when I have to unfortunately go to a patient and tell them that the Imaging that I got for them for their belly pain or for their weight loss or for their frequent you know urination or their inability to urinate um you know blood in their urine weight loss at that point A lot of times it's too late um you know and I hate to be graphic but these are the things that our patients at that point are commonly presenting with um when you know with their primary care provider they could have done testing um had the appropriate screening and maybe would not have been to that point um as others have also echoed um you know the survivability when you do the early screening and detection if it's combined and the cancer is confined at that point you know your survivability for at least prostate cancer is up to 98% so we're seeing that when you can intervene early I mean you're saving lives you're able to be there for your loved ones um and so if you don't get anything else from today I would like to just Echo screening screening screening is important um in with colon cancer we're seeing that less so I think before we were thinking oh I'm too young it's not time for me regardless of your family history a lot of times you may not have any symptoms um so that's why it's really important you know to think about these things to talk about these things with your loved ones to encourage others to do the same even if that's bringing your family member to their doctor's appointment and advocating whatever you have to do um you know just Advocate love on your loved ones and bring them in so that we can all be healthy and happy and have the ability to be with our loved ones thank you good morning everyone uh I'm Dr Anthony Jace I'm a director of population Health with inclusive care and and originally I was supposed to be here for support but uh my medical director Dr Dumas dragged me up here um and I can piggy back on everything that all the panelists said this morning um we can spit out a bunch of Statistics we can use a lot of big words but I like to always try to relate to my patients in layman's terms and the bottom line is prostate cancer and coloral cancer are two of the few few cancers that we can completely cure or get rid of if we catch it early now each of these cancers are associated with certain signs and symptoms you know with with the coloral cancer you you could have blood in your stool you could have abdominal pain you could have Chang in your your bow habits all of that you have weight loss same as as with with prostate cancer and Men it can an effect of you know how your year um as you get older you know you you develop these problems but I like to impress upon the patients is don't wait until you get problems because out of all of those symptoms that I just mentioned the main one that I always harop on is no symptoms at all I'm going say that again the biggest symptom is no symptom at all so how do we combat that we scream we go to the doctor we get checked regularly because once again these are two of the cancers that if addressed early enough there's a greater than 90% chance that you will die from something else other than those two cancers so if we could just impress that Upon Our patient populations um and then get past the negative uh stigma of getting tested then hopefully we can make up some ground as far as increasing our screenings and uh addressing these problems in our community thank you thank thank you this has certainly been very valuable thus far I want to thank our Health Care Professionals for the presentation that you made on this particular day because of the way we advertise it I know there might be more people watching than usual but also this taping will be shared with our with community members through not only the newsletter that I do but through other medium so I definitely want to thank you we're going to have an opportunity in a second for council members to comment and ask any questions we do have an organization that is being recognized today as the Benjamin and yansy foundation and I'm going to ask Dr Beth Bridges the vice president and co-founder she'll take a couple of minutes to tell us about it because persons who are affected by this disease need to know that there are people in organizations who are ready to hear and help them to get the resources they need Dr Bridges good morning my name is Beth Bridges I am a co-founder and vice president of the Benjamin y Foundation to my left is Mrs Jean Benjamin who is the co-founder and president of the organization and to her left is Miss Elizabeth Bridges Townson who's our media director back in December of 2017 we founded the Benjamin yansy Foundation it was named after 20 phenomenal Educators collectively had given 70 years of service to the great of New Orleans um area and they lost their fight to breast cancer after that Mrs Jean Benjamin husband detected prostate cancer and we realized there wasn't a lot of um resources as you will so we decide to add that to our mission also to address PR Street cancer um we offer educational workshops we do support um meetings for our men who have prostrate cancer also to the breast cancer um recipients we to support things we also do cancer kits but you know I just attended a meeting two weeks ago in Washington DC it's called the zero prostate cancer and we're on the hill petitioning our congressmen to push this bill that's going to um do that's going to reach education it's going to do resource and it's going to um have men come in and have these tests done it was also brought to my attention at that meeting that Louisiana you know we always the last on the first list and first on the last list that in this particular State we have more men dying from prostate cancer because of lack of screening so we are petitioning all of you the council and all of these um medical professionals to get behind us this year because we want to do a Citywide screening because children deserve to have a father women deserve to have a husband and a house deserve to have a man and we have to become our brothers Keepers you know to stop this cancer because if it's catch early is curable and is treatable thank you very much sorry and thank you for introducing Mrs Jean Benjamin vappy and Elizabeth Townson thank you all for the work that you do and it makes difference good is Saving Lives thank you so at this time for for a minute I'm going to ask each member of the council to make comments but also to let members know that we have a segment where we're going to be recognizing survivors of prostate or colon cancer through during their remarks so I'll start with council member Leslie Harris thank you uh council member green for uh your commitment to this and thank you to the panelist I can tell you that my grandmother died from colon cancer because she was one of the people who stuck her head in the sand and did not get checked and had uterine cancer that then spreads to her colon so um you know as much as we press men to get screened women also need to be screened as well so I I you know loud and clear women please go get your um colonoscopy and I will tell you I'm a hypocrite hypocrite right now because I have not gone to get one but I have one scheduled in April um and I had the box that I could not use so I was like let me just go through this um so I am going to get checked but I really would encourage women and men to go get screen because it is absolutely curable and you know losing my grandmother to something that was curable [Music] um is really upsetting so thank you for being here today thank you to the survivors and council member King thank you for having your family here today to cheer us up on this day that release should be celebrated thank you thank you council member auso you want to okay Freddy's been here longer than I have all right okay well it's all the panelists thank you for the information um thank you for the testimonials and I want to just Echo what has been echoed already um early screening is is the key so I I know people personally who were screened early um and they were able to to defeat this cancer on the flip side of people who didn't and it it took them so I just want to Echo what's been said already early detection early screening and this is something that's truly preventable and curable thank you well thank you for uh the entire panel for for not only for being here but of course for for the work that you do um in your professions in our community every single day you know to to be honest look let's just call it like it is I mean so often people don't want to get these tests because they're embarrassed to get the tests um they think that it's you know uh uh whether it's uh you know like too much of a violation even you know some say when you talk about these particular tests so I'm 46 years old obviously now I hit the mark where I needed to get um uh a colonoscopy or you know get an analysis done right and so I went to my doctor she informed me of this and you know just like council member Harris was talking about like me too that they were they were like here's your your little cig guard box thing that came in the mail and just like council member Harris I'm just going to be very honest I was like I I am not sure if I can do this but you know to your point doctor it's what test works for you so I called my doctor and I said you know what I'm just can I just come in and just get the whole colonoscopy can I just do that she's like absolutely let's set you up let's get you an appoint and you know I'd heard or I thought I didn't even really hear it's like I thought in my mind I'm like this is going to be so terrible this is going to be like such a like horrible test like oh my gosh and how am I going to drink this liquid and it's going to be just awful can I just tell you it was not that big of a deal it really was not that big of a deal for me because I eat I have to eat all the time like I'm one of those people that's constantly eating the hardest part for me was not being able to get up and like have a big breakfast like that was hard and having to be on like chicken br the day before like that was the hardest part of the whole thing and I'll tell you this when I finally got the test for everyone who's listening let me just tell you about the test so just like just like I'm sure everyone else who's having their first colonoscopy like what is this going to be like oh my gosh you know I'm just may I'm a little bit embarrass I don't know what's it going to be like okay it was so easy and I had the best nap I've had in like I can't even remember okay I mean I I don't know exactly what kind of you know drugs you all used to to you know make you to go to sleep for those few minutes but I'm telling you I didn't want to wake up I mean they were like Miss Moreno you know we really got to get you going and I'm like can I stay a little bit longer so so the test was so incredibly easy um and I remember even coming back and telling you know fellow council members because I told them that I was going for a colonoscopy um how easy it was and ever since then to my friends who have been like maybe embarrassed or not wanting to do the test feeling a little reluctant I've been constantly telling them just how easy it is and I get it the box is a little weird for some it may be great but it's it was a little weird for me but for those who you know opt to take get the colonoscopy it is so incredibly easy and the best part about it you know if you do go and get one and the results are are fairly positive you don't have to come back for several years which is also really great um so anyway so that was my story that was my message it it is incredibly easy all those thoughts you may have in your mind you can actually do away with them because it's super easy and once again if you get that colonoscopy you'll get some pretty good sleep too so thank you all thank you council president councilman Thomas uh thank you uh council member green and uh the staffs who worked on this um as I look at the panel I see uh medical Angels really uh people I've worked with in the community uh Dr Griggs over 10 years ago uh WB we started a show uh get check get F get fit get moving get moving but focus on African-American men and women in their overall Wellness uh 30 years ago uh Dr McKenna uh you did a commissioned a study on black men and boys 30 years ago about their their overall Wellness uh just recently The Brookings Institute came out a report about how black men and boys are in Jeopardy in the face of every social institution from their Wellness to their economic stability CNBC just came out with a report Dr Val that says that's our black men and boys are being left out of the economy uh Dr Dum family has been committed to our medical Wellness for years it's 1.2 and 1.7% when you talk about these two cancers especially as it relates to our mortality rate I say that because overall Wellness and General Health is really not about race but when you talk about mortality race and disparity it absolutely is uh about race I was fortunate enough and I am fortunate enough to have a doctor uh during my general checkup and wellness uh who didn't wait ask for my permission to schedule it Dr McKenna scheduled it and told me what day what day was going to go and I think I say that because for the men and women at the table uh y'all have worked hard to make sure that we can live in spite of Dr Val your comment it says what what it tells you and in the research and conversations that Dr Griggs and I have had there's another indicator uh that led to Dr McKenna's report on black men and boys uh that LEDs to the work that lcmc does for overall Wellness for Black Folk that led to the efforts of Dr Dumis and Dr Val and others and it says exposure to our environment those medical those nutritional things right uh the disparity that happens after the fact is one thing but to understand what Charles blow says and what it means to be African-American in step out of your door the stresses of the environment that have an impact on not just our overall Wellness but our ability and inability to fight diseases that are not just manifested for us so Dr Val when you said what did it what does it tells you it says that Society Dr Griggs and Dr McKenna Dr Dumas Dr Jace young lady has to take a greater look at our exposure to stuff into stresses into stress into disparities that other communities are not exposed to thank you thank you council member Thomas council members good morning I I I just want to say that I think it's so important to have this discussion publicly I mean I've said this so many times whether it's about mental health whether it's about breast cancer awareness when we're here for that I think particularly when you're dealing with color rectal issues it's even more uncomfortable and maybe considered go to talk about it or un impolite to talk about it out loud uh but it it's a part of being a human being and something I think as council member King and as obviously all of you have said that is easily preventable easily treatable and so much about this is destigmatizing and making sure that people know getting early care getting early access to care having a good healthy diet is is the best things that we can all do so I appreciate you all continuing to lift this issue up and making sure that people know that you don't need to hide it's okay as council members Harris and Moreno said to go to the doctor and not be scared the fear of going is actually worse than the going itself so we appreciate that and to council member King's Daughter I heard you playing upstairs and you send it great thank you thank you this is a great morning um our presenters have added so much and I know that those members of the public who are watching now or who are going to be watching in the future will appreciate the information that they got we also have an opportunity to celebrate today some survivors of colon of prostate cancer and I'm going to start off with a proclamation I'm going to offer this Proclamation and ask that it be myself council member juso and council member Harris they know this guy very well whereas the City of New Orleans is renowned for its food festivals famous citizens and foreign visitors and whereas the city council takes great pride in paying tribute to events and activities now therefore being proclaimed by the City of New Orleans that the New Orleans city council recognizes someone who's part of our team Derek Broomfield Derek groomfield is a prostate cancer survivor he's also a member of the council security team and this Proclamation says that we wish you the best and a permanent recovery from this disease thank you for sharing your success with others who can benefit from knowing your story stand for a second Mr brunfield so that people can see and we're going to take a picture afterwards but Mr Broomfield thank you for always being willing to talk about your survival and also how you can help others in that respect I also have a proclamation um for an organization that was introduced today and they are an organization whose members are committed to helping other citizens other residents respond to and survive live in the midst of the breast cancer and prostate cancer challenges especially but I'm so pleased to recognize with those same Proclamation words the Benjamin and yansy Foundation thank you for your commitment to helping and recognizing survivors of breast cancer and prostate cancer your work emphasizing early detection is paying great dividends in our community and we'll present this Proclamation at the front but thank you very much um for the work that you've done and for also continuing to Shine the Light on what you experien and how what you experien can help others the way it can help others thank [Applause] you but this this next recipient I I've known for quite some time and um the men and women at the table can tell you that people who face immortality uh and survive it is something different about them and I never really knew why this person re their Humanity uh even when you would talk to them but you would be in their presence right you could feel their spirit and now I know why uh I know why Carol Johnson's humanity is bigger than who she is as a person and why when you're in her presence you can feel the fact that she puts others first and she puts herself second and why she's a great servant but now I know uh because I didn't know uh that she was a Survivor and this reads that the city council takes great pride in paying tribute to events and activities now therefore be it be it proclaimed that we recognize Cara Johnson Survivor prostate and colon cancer awareness difficult roads can lead to beautiful destinations there's always hope beyond what you see my hope is that people would not have to face their morality or face a time when they were on the bottom looking up looking up but that God could give them Humanity so that people could see it no matter what they're going through and Kyo represent say God bless you [Applause] K council president Helena Moreno thank you council member green uh

have two minutes followed by Amanda fairy good excuse me I got no good morning morning how you doing all right so my comment if you can get a little closer to the mic so we can hear you thank you hear me now yep perfect thank you yeah good morning I'm Antonio Kush a 34 year old resident of New Orleans since 2012 originally from Alabama um to in the interest of brevity I'm not going to go into too much details but to say my comment on ISS 12 of the agenda of basically how you all are allowed to take vacation times and how you're paid for it I'm not for it I'm not against it I just don't care I think there are other issues that are a lot more pressing that should be on the agenda such as the 600 officer deficit that we facing in the City of New Orleans I think um accountability among the city council issues of who's going to be the next mayor and that being the topic of conversation in a lot of these meetings I think those things are more important I think it's more important that we have transparency for the citizen citizenry and accountability for the actions of the council in regards to how you all are paid outside of the city council for example Andrew Cholo's company we Partners being paid by several council members of which I have a list for services um with Government Contracting and what have you that we don't know why you're paying your coworker outside of the business it seems to be a conflict of interest when you all are here to represent our interest and what we need and we have residents who can't have lights who don't have water but we're here to address vacation time and who's going to get paid and how we're going to divide up the money for vacation time I think it's uh slapping the face of the citizenry to have these type of things on the agenda when we have more pressing issues and and to that I'm representing the organization takeback Nola initiative where we are going to take actions to bring these issues to the Forefront and demand changes within the way our government is run that's your time Mr Kush thank you so muche that's two minutes that was two minutes thank you appreciate two minutes to me thank you Amanda fairy good you're up next followed by Michael Eric burn side good morning good morning my name is Amanda fairy good I am a second semester graduate student at the University of New Orleans New Orleans is rich in history and culture it is important that we do what we can to preserve that culture whether by stopping the demolition of buildings and homes or by limiting short-term rentals so I will be addressing communication 13 that was on the agenda short-term rentals do provide alternative housing for tourism however they also change the hospitality industry negatively affect housing availability and impact neighborhood culture the affordable housing crisis in New Orleans is continually increasing in gravity and affects the economic success of low income individuals there is already a shortage of affordable homes in New Orleans for families living below the poverty line and short-term rentals can lessen the opportunities for affordable housing a Boston study found when there's an increase in Airbnb listings rent increases typically when there's a 1% increase in Airbnb listings there's also a 8% increase in rental rates although these effects seem minuscule consider that airbnb's average growth from year to year is about 44% although the City of New Orleans has placed limits of three short-term rentals per City Square block and allow locals who are natives to New Orleans to own and operate the short-term rentals that they live in and to proceive to receive a permit there seems to be more that could be done what zoning regulations can be put in place to further limit the concentration of short-term rentals in the neighborhood and are there any tax credit or other options that can be put in place to motivate Property Owners to change short-term rentals back into long-term rentals to increase the available affordable housing thank you thank you Miss fairy good appreciate your comments uh Michael Eric Burnside you're up next I was going to speak on number 29 which is on page 17 but it's been withdrawn so I think I'll just not but I will mention on number one which I've always mentioned which is September I'm going to probably you know 2% chance of getting arrested because nothing's being done nothing's being fixed and a year will go by When September Comes and I figure what the hell you know everybody else is upset I might as well join them um and I think I'll let it go with that for now thank you thank you Mr Burnside any public comments online yeah we have three online comments okay go ahead first one is regarding Communication number 13 the hdlc uh decision regarding 24 30 Rampart Street this is from Kip holler on behalf of the faberg Marin Improvement Association Kip says obviously what has been done cannot be undone they can't put back what they already demolished so I conc to the hdlc decision to allow retention of the demolition however I believe heft your fines need to be assessed $10,000 is merely the cost of doing business this is a mety domiciled investor that currently owns eight investment properties in Orleans Parish he knows the rules and he knows what he's doing he purpose disregarded the approved drawings and hoped that he wouldn't get caught hit him with a fine of $250,000 or the maximum allowed under law uh the other two comments are regarding um number 22 this is uh calendar number 34560 regarding zoning at 130 South Telus Michelle Schley says we are a residential rear neighboring property to 130 South Telus and our writing regarding the provisors to allow storage on the property for this recently rezoned neighborhood commercial establishment the owner of this property has leased space to the nonprofit Soul save our Urban landscape at a 25 plus year residence behind as a 25 plus year resident behind this property we do not want to live next to a tree plant nursery regardless of their intention we have spoken to the owner of the property who says this will not happen but now it's on the agenda today we are asking the council to deny today today's agenda item and Proviso and only allow the following that the building use can only be used as Administrative Office Space within their stated designated business hours that soul may not use the yard for any type of storage of trees mounts of dirt or additional organic matter for intending planting on site that the property the building property not be used to house or permit overnight stays to any transient volunteers who may be from out of town that know outdoor signage be permitted that the rod iron driveway gate be reinstalled there's currently a chain link uh crossing the driveway where the rod iron driveway  used to be and this could be improved upon the executive director of Soul spoke to at the CPC meeting on January 9th 2024 and noted that the building will be used for their administrated offices only and and storage of their two trucks in the yard and will operate during set business hours the CPC report recommendation was for denial of the application and CPC went on again were again went against the recomendation and voted to allow the neighborhood commercial establishment and allow the owner to lease the space to the nonprofit soul with heror to designate the office space but one a step further I noted that by right the conditional use would allow sold to store toes items to support their mission in the very large yard on site please consider the neighbors and the original intent that Soul came to the to the table with next comment is same item from Kimble Schley who says we appreciate your limiting the neighborhood commercial establishment went resoning at 130 southt Marcus as restricted to office space only we are glad for that however as a rear-facing property we strongly object to Soul being allowed to trans to store trees mounds of dirt and organic matter on site at the original CPC meeting Soul noted that there were no plans to have storage only office and storage uh of their two trucks that the CPC took their application a step further and voted to overrule the report recommendation of denial and to additionally allow storage by W even though they are only leasing the property they do not own the property as a 25 plus year resident and homeowner behind 130 South Telus we do not want to live behind a tree nursery we ask that you reconsider the Proviso and withdraw it andor vote no that's it for the online comments for consent okay thank you Anita a motions been made by council member green seconded by council member juso all in favor of the consent agenda please vote your machines we have five Ys I think we're about to have a six 6 y 6 Ys and no Nays and the consent agenda is adopted council member do you want to go to the matter yes item 17 please we're on page 33 wait a second we have a legislative group in ordinance calendar number 34559 by council member King an ordinance to establish a conditional use to permit a hotel over 5000 s ft in floor area in a Hu muu historic Urban neighborhood mix use District mad that's not the right item the hang on the item is I'm sorry is is uh calendar number 34571 okay on page 38 there we go no no sorry our our forms are mislabeled there we go not the agenda just my internal form there we go item 19 on page 38 ordinance calendar number 34571 by council members Paris and Mareno by request an ordinance to authorize the revocation by the city of certain public rights of way located adjacent to Caesars Superdome in New Orleans Louisiana and to authorize the disposition by the City of New Orleans of certain land including aforesaid public rights of way and improvements thereon located adjacent to the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans Louisiana which property is defined as the city Exchange Land in the act of revocation of Street dedication and act of exchange attached hereto as exhibit a the act of exchange in exchange for immovable property owned by the state of Louisiana designated as parcel a in square 340 parcel C in square 333 and the portion of Liberty Street that runs between such squares in the first Municipal District of the City of New Orleans which property is defined as the state Exchange Land in the act of exchange and otherwise to provide with respect thereto thank you madam clerk Miss Conik hi um the New Orleans building Corporation is happy to present to you guys the the which assets we've been discussing for a while is the land swap between the state of Louisiana and the City of New Orleans in exchange for streets that are adjacent to the Superdome which are South Street a portion of Dave Dixon Drive the green space on West Stadium Drive and the median on between Pis and uh Sugar Bowl Drive the city will transfer that to the state of Louisiana in exchange for the state's portion of Duncan Plaza and all of the heel garage so in the 1950s this the City of New Orleans sold to the state of Louisiana a portion of the Duncan Plaza where they built the garage and they had their former office building which was destroyed during Hurricane Katrina so it's in some respects cing full circle because now we're going to have the entirety of Duncan Plaza and sort of set the table for the future consideration of a Civic complex on that site um so we respectfully request um uh approval and certainly thank the governor's office the mayor for greenlighting this and the board of directors in the city council who have uh especially council member Moreno who has lent her powers all of you to getting this done and it's been a long time coming and so we're happy to have been able to have the privilege to participate in it thank you council member green it has been a long time coming and I want to thank you for your work that you've done to make this possible certainly I'm going to ask that I be you know added this is a new City Hall that's going to be possible so I want to certainly be added as a you know co-sponsor of this but you know this is something that um I know involves a lot of negotiations and the The District Council person and our Council um president was certainly involved but I do want to recognize the work of the New Orleans building Corporation a lot goes on behind the scenes to make this happen and um this is a good deal for the state since they've been using our streets all these years at no cost no I'm just joking we get a new parcel for City Hall to be able to build something that's conducive to what the citizens of our city need and also to have something that is of the highest Tech value potentially and also just something that is a good use of um Duncan Plaza I'm jumping ahead of it because it's going to take a little while before it's a city hall but this land swap is so very important thank you very much for your work you're welcome we appreciate that and it is absolutely a team effort we have a good team over at um New Orleans building Corporation Council president Mareno thank you I mean at the end of the day this is something that's been worked on really now for for decades from Administration to Administration it's um you know something that has taken a long time to come to fruition but it really is a deal of a lifetime uh a really impactful deal for the City of New Orleans and also very beneficial for the state of Louisiana and LSC as well so um to all the parties that have been involved in this and it's been a very collaborative effort with Taylor Bara the commissioner for division of administration uh of course LSC uh Hillary Landry has been very impactful in this as well the mayor's office uh the governor's office of course the the city C um but more than anything um Cindy to you and to your team uh to Scott Whitaker as well uh you all were the ones that always you know kept kind of the Train on on its tracks and making sure that uh we had all of our eyes dotted and tees crossed um to move this forward and and the next step is you know moving this on to having the the commissioner sign this for his um final approval but like I said this has been a long time coming and I'm just very grateful for everyone coming together to to get it done to benefit not just the city but also the state of Louisiana thank you thank you thank you and uh Cindy I I couldn't say it better thank you for all of your work and I understand that you have a new teammate um Annie McBride um so I I look forward to working with her in the future um and we do have one comment Michael Eric Burnside you got two minutes any online comments Adam okay Michael Eric Burnside 2215 Felicity and I stand here both in opposition and in unhappiness so the NPD headquarters has rats and the nopd headquarters doesn't have elevators that work and the NPD headquarters apparently hasn't had air conditioning for like 6 months we are not good Property Owners City Hall needs a new city hall because everybody's bitching about the city hall they got and it was built in 1950 we can't take care of the buildings we have why are we building new ones we have a huge amount of space that we do not use including the old VA Hospital which is located here and has plenty of parking we don't use it there are many other buildings owned by the city we do not use at all we are very bad Property Owners extremely bad to the point where I at West Virginia hillbilly who has worshiped at the altar of private property for over 50 years of my life have to say out loud in public that we should become renters and not property owners and I cannot tell you how hard that hurts me because ownership comes with not just just responsibility but opportunity and power and the chance for change but we throw away again and again and again we come in here and we say oh we need new we need new we need new and we don't take care of the old it matters I am taken for homeless often I tried walking down south Liberty Street to Champion square and I got stopped by a private security guard when I first came into the city in 2015 we're giving the way the right to approach the Caesar Dome when the Super Bowl is here they will put up fences and they will exclude protesters and in exchange we're being given land on which we can build a new building that we do not need and cannot take care of thank you thank you Mr Burnside all right I'm going to go ahead and move once the machine comes up second second of my council president Marina six shase thank you s 78 thank you Cindy thank you Annie can we all be added as members on this one so significant yeah we can add everyone as thank you coauthors we're now on page 30 39 this is the matter okay we have a legislative group [Applause] in ordinance calendar number 3459 by council members Moreno Morel juso Harris King green and Thomas and ordinance calling for an election on November the 5th 2024 at which the electors of the City of New Orleans shall be asked to approve an amendment to Article 2 Section 2-202 of the home R Charter adding workers right to the municipal Bill of Rights and otherwise to provide with respect there too and there is an amendment on top of page 40 by council member Moreno on page one of exibit a on the third line of the second to last unnumbered paragraph delete the blank line and insert the excuse me insert the following $44,000 number two on page one of exhibit a delete the last unnumbered paragraph that is the amendment thank you Madam cler let me take up the amendment uh first these are um some technical Corrections and also putting in the exact amount uh to put this on the ballot as well so I'll make a motion to adopt the amendment executive by council member juso all in favor 7 years no n this is the workers Bill of Rights um as you all are aware uh we have a city Bill of Rights that is in the charter and it lists the the city's value statements uh but until until now um well hopefully if it passes in the fall uh there really been no mention about uh workers rights and so this city council and and working with different Advocates and of course the workers of the city is now putting forth uh language talking about what uh we believe uh uh workers deserve in the City of New Orleans so that includes having a a safe working environment that includes um having the right to have health care coverage that includes uh equal pay of course uh that includes a living wage so those are some of the items that are going to be now mentioned should this ballot measure be approved in the fall and I think at this critical time particularly with what's happening uh at the state capital right now where there's been a movement for anti-worker legislation I think it's really important for New Orleans to continue to be that strong voice to support our workers and so that's why this is important so long the city uh so long in the city it it's it's it seems like workers have felt that they just don't have a voice this right here will help give them a voice um with that I'll turn it over to council member Thomas and other council members who'd like to make comments and then public comments no just thank you for this effort uh if we'll hearken back uh a few decades we'll remember when uh the New Orleans city council actually actually passed a minimum wage to separate us from this state the fact that we should be able to control or have some say into what the benefits were were and with the workers made uh that city council effort that we LED uh over a decade or plus ago was killed in the courts but I think it's more important now because we're under assault workers are under assault throughout this country and as a member uh of of a family uh with leading union members like T Henry my mother with CWA my father before he was disabled when he was a long shman Shan uh I think uh council member uh at least if nothing else we can go on offense and I'm sure it'll be challenged uh Miss Davis bacon and right to work state but I know all of the uh council members I served with earlier like council member Carter and Hur and others when we passed an ordinance uh that was unanimous uh that was approved and then to be defeated in the courts uh this is another step in the direction to go back and do what darthy M Taylor and the Jim Singleton and the Johnny Jacksons and even after that with our ordinance what we tried to do uh a decade plus ago so thank you guys for this effort let's hopefully the courts realize uh that workers not only should have rights uh but they should be treated right thank you council member Thomas council member Council vice president moral thank you uh like Council M Thomas I like to applaud uh council president Moreno as well as St up Louisiana for their efforts to get this to this point I think what's really interesting and I think this T which is very different than previous tax is there is always this misconception put forth by people who are anti-worker that the public does not support what the council is doing that real people don't support unions don't believe in unions all they care about is the coffee being 50 cents less or the room being a dollar less and I think by doing this in this framework by putting it on the ballot you're not just saying a message from this Council you're saying a message from the city you're telling businesses that consumers expect you to treat their workers properly that those people who are paying for that Starbucks Coffee the people that are renting that hotel room the people that are interacting with their businesses that they see these workers they see what they do and they also see what businesses are doing to these people and I would tell you that what I will find very interesting as this effort goes on the ballot is seeing what these businesses do because it's very dangerous to come out and oppose something like this when the public has shown nationally that they are willing to show their support with their wallets and like I said it'll be very interesting to see who shows up against this and what the repercussions are from consumers who have overwhelmingly in this city and in this country support a minimum wage support workers rights support equal pay all these things that government says the public doesn't want this mechanism that's being done this way lays out all of that in detail and lets the public finally weigh in to say no you don't speak for us we speak for ourselves thank you council president thank you Council Vice President we have public comment Jack Reno Sweeney followed by David Williams hello council members Jack Rino Sweeny representing the New Orleans Democratic Socialist of America an all volunteer organization of approximately 400 dues paying members we're proud to support step Up's Initiative for a workers Bill of Rights as the council as council member Moreno alluded to in Baton Rouge The Landry Administration has wasted no time trying to tear apart whatever shreds of the social safety net we have left in this state paying special attention to wiping out any basic protections for workers in the name of extracting wealth from the people to enrich those who are already wealthy and Powerful every Louisiana with a conscience has a duty to stand up for their neighbors and for themselves to fight back against this Onslaught against our rights and our well-being New Orleans as a city has a special responsibility to lead on the issue of workers rights being the economic engine of the whole state and home to hundreds of thousands of workers who are in Landry's crosshairs but who are also ready and willing to stand up against his efforts the workers Bill of Rights demonstrates our City's commitment to Justice fairness and equality its passage and an affirmative vote in the fall would represent a commitment from the city at every level to building a better Louisiana that goes far beyond Governor Landry's austere and destructive vision for our future thank you in particular to council member Moreno for supporting this initiative to lay the Bedrock for a movement to defend working Louisianans from extremist and anti-worker policies coming from our state government and its ultra wealthy cronies trying to keep our economy and our communities in their grip this is only the beginning of a fight but when we fight we win Thank you very much thank you Mr Sweeney David Williams followed by Britain foresight good morning everybody good morning my name is David Williams I'm a stock at Dollar General and have been employed there for 4 and A2 years the workers bill of rice is super important because retail corporations line their pockets up while paying us pennies I'm only making bare minimum after 4 and a half years a right to a fair living wage will tell the companies that we deserve better and a right to the basic necessities to survive I'm asking that you don't continue to turn the Blind Eye to corporate greed thank you thank you Mr Williams Britain foresight followed by Robert Horton Hey Y'all I'm excited to be here today Britain foresight I'm the legislative coordinator for stepup Louisiana I've met with a lot of your offices to talk about this I really appreciate all of your support I'm excited to come into this hearing with all council members signed on know this amendment gives New Orleans a chance to finally say as a city how we believe workers should be treated I look forward to a public conversation leading up to the ballot to talk about workers rights and any subsequent policies that we're planning to bring up to really back up this statement so you know thank you all so much I think uplifting the workers of the city uplifts the whole city and we state firmly that worker health is public health so thank you thank you Britton Robert Horton followed by Nadia Muhamed morning council members my name is Robert Haron I reside at 2733 North Priia I'm here to support the workers Bill of Rights and I thank each and every one of you for at least taking the time to pay attention to this issue council person Marino Morel Oliver Thomas and the rest of you thank you again you know because finally we're putting the people first for a change in this city you know we know we live in a city since hurricane Katrina we really haven't seen them back from you know people are catching hell still living check to check living with rents that's out of control and don't know how they're going to make it to work or to school or keep gas in the vehicles working two and three jobs for that matter not to mention there's no kind of boundaries put upon employees with what they impose upon folks outside of their job descriptions so a workers Bill of Rights will bring legal protection for the employees for change essential workers are not just the folks who are doctors in the hospital but it's the sanitation workers it's our domestic industry that fuels the economy here in the City of New Orleans you know and so with that being said those boundaries would also make this town union friendly for everyone that way we can all have some serious protections and it's a benefit it's a win-win for the City of New Orleans overall because if you got folks who want to come and move to New Orleans then it's an invitation to say we take care of our people here we don't exploit our people here and finally we know we have this issue of crime and safety in the City of New Orleans when you employ folks and you enhance their quality of life then we see a decrease in the crime here that Mr Couron thank you Nadia Muhammad good morning council and staff my name is Nadia Muhammad and I thank you all for allowing me this opportunity to speak on behalf of workers Bill of Rights and as sister Moreno had said that the rights is to a fair living wage with $15 minimum wage the right to have a paid leave for medical care and families on vacation the right to organize the union free from threats intimidations or interference the right to Health Care coverage these are the bill workers Bill of Rights the right to have minimum wage is increasingly important if you are a parent or a not in 22 states are increasing their minimum wages in this year 2024 but not Louisiana is not one of them a minimum wage increase in these 22 States going to affect this year but Louisiana remains one over a dozen states that is keeping the federal minimum wage the right to a living wage the right not not to worry about your light bill water bill or worry about your unpaid rent or having your contents of your home on the sidewalk which is very embarrassing the right to have paid medical leave I went out on medical leave although I paid for long-term disability trying to get assistance was to no avail I was one step from sleeping under the bridge I thank God for family and my sisters that allow me to stay in their home until I was able to get disability which you know it takes at least a year or more the right to organize a union in our workplace we need someone to speak up and to go to bat for us by having a union is not only investing now as an employee and an employer Muhammad yes start to wrap up please okay good your time all right what you're going I'm pleading with the council to accept the workers Bill of Rights as we speak not only for ourselves but also for the millions of workers in the United States this workers Bill of Right is the first in our city first in our state first in our country so let's move forward to be the first to sign in this law thank you Mr would appreciate you Anita any public comment

2030 Move adoption Second All in favor Lets vote The motion was passed with six votes in favor and none against The motion is adopted Thank you constituent Affairs liaison council member Freddy King III District C transmitting the mayor's office of economic development's recommendation of disapproval and requesting the scheduling of a public hearing for the following restoration tax abatement application 939 Iberville Street French Quarter Apartments limited partnership this was revised on March the 5th 2024 we have resolution lying over R 2471 by council member King a resolution approving the RTA renewal application 20141 1425 939 Iberville Street and on the top of page P 21 there is an amendment to the resolution R 2471 by council member King number one in the second recital delete r2010 and insert r157 17 and L thereof number two in the third recital after the words recommends denial of the insert the words renewal of the that is the amendment thank you mad clerk Mr bar side so my worldview and the governor are different I think that uh people need jobs uh the governor thinks the state needs investment and in the age of AIS and robots investment does not equal jobs so uh back in 2014 maybe things were a little bit different uh 2014 was 10 years ago its a long time ago this RTA was started this is a renewal the renewals are supposed to happen after 5 years which would have been 2019 according to what I read uh there's been no DB participation at all 0% uh from what I read the jobs are for management jobs there's no discussion of contract jobs uh as I understand the paperwork the RTA is for $50 million but the assessor has the building more or less assess to 25 million and the RTA will take it back to like 2 million so this may not matter to a lot of people but the idea that the rich don't really pay their fair share of property taxes is uh an ongoing losing battle here in New Orleans we have a lot of rich people who are actually nonprofits we have a lot of rich people who are churches uh this particular Rich individual uh let his little let me get this right here because I dont quite trust myself uh French Quarter Apartments limited partnership in the Secretary of State's website site is uh lapsed uh the gentleman who owns this or the 80 gentlemen who own this are an international company that works in Russia and other places so I don't really think that their upscale apartment is really beneficial to the workers of New Orleans and I don't really believe they should be getting a tax rate Steve stores good late morning to everybody um in 2014 I represent the owners of the uh French Quarter apartment the uh owners took a bold move to uh renovate a two nearly 200,000 foot empty building into 87 um targeted for upscale Apartments to try to push the rents to try to create long-term ownership and stability including more paying more taxes the Pro in 2017 the project hit some construction uh bumps we achieved 36% dbe compliance we um had to correct some defects from that happened along the way which we did in 18 and 19 and then in 20 there was Co the project has never achieved more than 80% um effective total occupancy and our rents are substantially less we're here to request a second period of abatement so that we can continue to try to achieve higher rents over the long term and get to 95% kind of occupancy and ultimately pay um far more taxes and do better um and the uh comments of the prior speaker ignore the fact that we overachieved on the dbe we've continued to invest in the property we had to make $5 million of corrections which we did so the building is textbook perfect and we're proud to have been in New Orleans and try to continue on a long-term basis so 5 years from now uh we can report back that we've achieved the higher occupancy and the higher rents and paid more taxes but we'd like some help to try to get there um I'll be GL to take any questions seeing none move to the next next speaker Mr Scott sorry I can't make out the last name uh good afternoon or midday Council Scott huitt on behalf of the ownership of 939 Iberville I I'm kind of seconding what Mr stole um stated but succinctly the long-term benefits of granting the renewal of the RTA will benefit the city uh far more financially than denying the the renewal it is a this was an aggressive project and it's been an aggressive investment and longterm allowing you know this kind of Niche development to maintain High rents and to continue investing in the city that the tax burden on the ownership following the the abatement period will significantly increase and will far outweigh the value of the abatement that is or the renewal of the abatement that is sought here today thank you thank you any comments from the D any online comments I just time make a motion to make a motion it's the amendment I'm sorry so second by council member green the uh motion is amended now move to adopt the resolution as amended

small billboard um there's Google map pictures and all the rest of it so it seems odd that a serious zoning change needs to be done to accommodate a billboard uh there seems to me to be other answers to this situation but I am grateful that uh the great billboard creators in the sky were kind enough to limit everything to 10,000 fet David Halper Madam chairman members of the council David Hal 26 Swan Street New Orleans Louisiana uh I can only Echo the comments made by uh Mr jardo we represent Lamar Advertising who is the Billboard operator on the location are the OWN owned it and their predecessor owned it since 1998 it's been a great billboard there's no reason to change it Xavier approached Lamar and said look we need to develop this property uh they've been a great partner with us uh they do great things for the City of New Orleans we can't possibly stand in their way the only thing we can do is agree with them to move our billboard to another location we spent a lot of time the City Planning Commission staff uh trying to find a location and this is the only one that we're able to find that is not too close to the neighbors it's close enough another to commercial operations and uh is appropriate under all circumstances so we appreciate the staff's efforts we appreciate the city planning commission's vote in favor of it and we ask that you support the

council member may maybe nobody wants a second yeah Council I'm noticing some of these seconds are slow depending on anyway I don't want to get in one of them moves um mov by me second by council member juso we don't wanted to be a conspiracy now U Move adoption all the eyes eyes have it any any GS eyes have it so order on top of me 34609 by council members juso Mareno Harris and Thomas by request and ordinance to ordain section 704115 28230 that as a result of Tourism getting certain benefits that then there would be money that went to infrastructure into the city however for whatever reason there was not the codification of the $5 million That was supposed to go annually to Su and water board as part of that and so this ordinance takes care of that and ensures that on a Perpetual basis because of the fair share allocation $5 million will go to Su and water board on an annual basis so I've moved seconded by council member Harris you put in a yellow card I didn't get one well sorry I did not that time I just didn't get one but Mr Burnside sorry Council I have to say that the words that time imply the previous times perhaps you yet okay so my name is Michael ER bernside I live at 2215 Felicity and I went to the Governor's task force for suian water board one week ago today in the in the evening and they had had another meeting today starting at a.m. which hopefully somebody sent a staff member to to keep track of what's going on there changes in the air um it may be like Intergy you may have a inste of a curo you may have a swen water bur or something I mean you got to be careful so I read this didn't really understand which is fine because I'm getting old but I do want to point out a couple of things about infrastructure that's already know but I want to like put it out there in public one of which of course is not everybody pays for drainage I think we all understand that how do we get all people to pay for drainage is a legitimate political question that you guys should be wrestling with and should have like staff focused on or maybe even some sort of little group to get together because depending on the numbers that the sewage and water board task force dealt with in public a week ago between 40 and 60% of the city apparently is not paying anything so if 40 to 60% of the city is not paying anything the people who are paying things is kind of like fee waivers for anority you know it's like why should I pay if you're not paying right and we would like to have drainage so it would be good if everybody paid as far as the rest of it goes some of the other numbers that came out were staggering I don't know that the numbers were true but a gentleman said that back in 2017 we paid such and such money for such and such catch Basin and it came out to $250 each for catch Basin to be cleaned in 217 and then somebody else came out with numbers that said well the city just signed a contract for the $10 million and you're only going to get 5000 catchup basins I hope that that's false because if it's true that's $2000 per catch Basin so things are getting ridiculous and somebody somewhere needs an auditor and somebody somewhere needs a oh I don't know the legislative branch whose power is the purse of the public needs to beef up its technical staff so that it can keep track of what money is being spent who is getting it and why the city's not really getting what it needs in return all right thank you Mr burn side um I had moved council member Harris second it was 70 thank you members at the bottom of the page ordinance calendar

event was for beloved member of our musical Community the waiver was promise of the family prior to the passage of the ordinance and introduced prior to the mayor signing the ordinance so I move to a do and thank you council member King beloved member of our cultural Community thank you thank you council member Thomas second by council member Harris seven Y no Nays motion is do at the bottom of the page ordinance calender number 34,0 614 by council members juso Mareno Harris green Thomas morale and King an ordinance to amend and reordain section 70- 415 327 70-41 15 328 70-41 15 329 of the code of the City of New Orleans to change the name of the affordable and Workforce housing Gap financing fund to expand the purpose of the fund to require annual Appropriations to the fund to require additional reporting to require the appointment of an advisory committee and establish the duties and rules for such committee and otherwise to provide with respect there to thank you madam clerk I think council member Harris referred to this as the belt and suspenders at the last meeting and that's how it characterized this as well it simply lays out in case the charter change happens not to pass how the city would create an affordable housing fund how it would be funded in its first year for what purposes it would be funded for in its first year and the process and procedure by which it would go through in its first year I think we have one online comment and I know I have three comment cards here so Mr Burnside Cheryl I don't know where there you are and Joe so Mr Burnside hi so Gap Gap financing is different than soft seconds and I understand that but uh the soft seconds on the website for the cities from 2019 they have X dollar they divide by x amount of money you get 50 people that got soft seconds in the last five years so a lot of things aren't necessarily belt and suspenders some things just don't hold things up so the next thing is that you you're buying different things right but you don't have the things you're buying matching the things you're needing so you need one bedrooms but you've got too many two bedrooms you need efficiencies okay um you can talk to Andre Nik Morris I realized that she has supporters and she has detractors but she's done a lot of work and she has a lot of numbers and it would not be a Miss for you to send your staff to talk to her cuz we're buying stuff we don't need and we need stuff we're not buying so as far as Gap financing goes we've done a couple of affordable housing things recently I've sent you emails the affordable housing's coming out to about like $384,000 a house this is the average cost of a normal house this isn't affordable housing well we're doing subsidizing rent for a few years and then after 45 years or 30 years or whatever the case is it'll go to market house housing which is what it's being built for in the first place it's being built as Market housing that's then going to be renovated and sold on the open market so we need to figure out a way to get people really poor person housing and not middle class housing and I realize that that's a big long complicated argument and I'm willing to lose it but I'm not willing to not have it because we're spending a lot of money already and we're not getting a heck of a lot for it thank you all right Miss Valerie and then Mr Haren Mueller good morning everybody my name is Cheryl Elaine Valerie I'm from Carlton Holly Gro um I haven't been to the center in a while um being homeless down the street at a it's kind of hard affordable housing is something that we need I just had a birthday a coig birthday March 11 I at 71 years of age I want to go home to my community Dr Rogers with csone agent he has a house behind the center I need a place to stay I need it now physical and mentally I need it now I hope you guys can do something I'm right down the street I walk down here about to walk back I might go holl at the me here again she wasn't in early Julius wasn't in everybody knows me Oliver I'm always on the radio Dr was here I was glad to see Dr I'm like I just want you guys to do the right thing I got a son who needs a place to stay he has a job I've been wanting to go back to S and work some more do my artwork I'm just tired it it's time for someone to get off their butts and do something thank you thank you Cheryl I I know you were here either a meeting or two ago and we tried to get somebody from Office Community Development down here so maybe if you hang out a little bit longer today we'll see if we can get somebody to come talk to you absolutely all right Mr Haren Mueller thank you uh Joe har Mueller Unity of Greater New Orleans I I want to thank uh council member juso and everybody here today thank you for your work on this um and for continuing to address the need for more affordable housing in our community as multiple speakers today have highlighted the need uh for uh affordable housing is a critical and um there's a ground it's there's a ground swell of people um in this community attested to by the comments today by a meeting that I attended earlier around homelessness um where the lack of affordable housing was pinpointed as um the the major driver in homelessness so we're glad to see yall working continuingly D diligently on this and we hope that as this um ordinance is enacted and and progressed that that special attention to special populations is given because people who are homeless people who are are really below 30% of Ami are especially at risk of um suffering the the greatest detriments of a lack of affordable housing so thank you thank you very much and I know coun member Harris has worked hard on that issue too council member green um the only thing that I want to say is I want people to do an analysis a deeper analysis of those who are unhoused because the housing first or the housing only policy is something that have to be discussed addiction and mental challenges have to be discussed and they have to be in there I don't believe that the vast majority of those who are unhoused are unhoused because of affordable housing and I think that we're doing them a diservice we're not looking at the people who are Trent the people who choose to not be inside and the people who have drug addictions that prevent them from doing so the only thing that I'm asking is when we use certain phrases terms make sure that they don't become rhetoric I have an opportunity to talk to a number of people who are unhoused and I will tell you that it's not because they lost a house it's not because they couldn't afford an apartment it's because there are challenges that are going on and sometimes the challenges are deep within I think that we're doing a disservice sometimes I just want to leave it at that I also look forward to supporting any measures that create housing to support our citizens including measures to help people get to the Home Ownership level at a larger level than we have in our city right now which is the real long-term solution to to the affordable housing crisis that we have if it is a if it is in fact a crisis council member J so I have the one online comment yes thank you this is from Steven Kennedy he says I'm writing today to express my support for ordinance number 34614 the AF affordable housing fund it's critically important to create a funding source to help increase the production of accessible affordable housing throughout the city many families across the city are cost burden paying over 50% of their household incomes on housing which makes it extremely difficult to pull them UPS pull themselves up by the boot straps assisting families with becoming homeowners will hopefully help some families begin to build wealth since home ownership has been a foundation for many towards that end nearly 55% of the city's residents are renters which make which makes it also imperative that the production of affordable rental units is increased helping tackle the problem of affordable rental housing across our city especially in high opportunity opportunity neighborhoods will help bring stability for Working Families I want to personally thank you each of you for your commitment towards affordable housing and a special thanks to council member Leslie Harris who has taken the lead on advocating for affordable housing and the need for a permanent funding source thank you I've moved it was seconded by council member Marino six but that hang on one second let me see if I can I know I
