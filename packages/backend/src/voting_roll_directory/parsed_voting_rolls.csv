and re-ordaining the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. M.C.S. 4264, as
amended by Ordinance No. 26,413 M.C.S. and subsequent amendments) to expand
community solar opportunities with the following considerations:
i. Consider defining a ""Community Solar Project"" as ""a solar
energy system constructed and operated by a public or
private entity that connects directly to the electricity
distribution network and converts solar energy into
electricity and/or stores energy for the primary purpose
of serving electric demands offsite from the facility.
Community solar projects may allow multiple local
subscribers to purchase or lease ownership shares
or a percentage of the power produced on the site.""
ii. Consider creating accessory use standards for ""Community
Solar Projects,"" which may include minimum lot size
requirements, setbacks, design standards, and/or landscaping
requirements.
iii. Consider amending Article 21.6.J of the Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance to read as follows:
""1. A collective alternative energy system such as
a community solar project, wind energy system,
or geothermal energy system is permitted to be
constructed upon one or more properties owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners
association, institutional campus, religious institution,

54. MOTION - NO. M-23-227 - BY: COUNCILMEMBER MORENO (BY REQUEST).
Brief:
Directing the City Planning Commission to conduct a public hearing to consider amending
and re-ordaining the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. M.C.S. 4264, as
amended by Ordinance No. 26,413 M.C.S. and subsequent amendments) to expand
community solar opportunities with the following considerations:
i. Consider defining a ""Community Solar Project"" as ""a solar
energy system constructed and operated by a public or
private entity that connects directly to the electricity
distribution network and converts solar energy into
electricity and/or stores energy for the primary purpose
of serving electric demands offsite from the facility.
Community solar projects may allow multiple local
subscribers to purchase or lease ownership shares
or a percentage of the power produced on the site.""
ii. Consider creating accessory use standards for ""Community
Solar Projects,"" which may include minimum lot size
requirements, setbacks, design standards, and/or landscaping
requirements.
iii. Consider amending Article 21.6.J of the Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance to read as follows:
""1. A collective alternative energy system such as
a community solar project, wind energy system,
or geothermal energy system is permitted to be
constructed upon one or more properties owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners
association, institutional campus, religious institution,
non-profit organization, or a public entity. Collective
alternative energy systems shall be permitted as
accessory use for the purpose of serving electric
demands on- site or offsite from, but related to, the
2. A collective alternative energy system may be
constructed on one or more contiguous lots owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners association,
institutional campus, religious institution, non-profit
organization, or a public entity. Where collective
alternative energy systems are constructed on two
or more contiguous lots, all owners shall agree to such
arrangement. The agreement shall be recorded as a
""collective alternative energy servitude"" on each plat
of survey to grant access to all participants to maintain
equipment. A management plan shall be submitted and
servitude recorded. The management plan shall clearly
detail the relationship between the accessory Collective
Alternative Energy System use and the related on-site
or off-site principal use or uses.
