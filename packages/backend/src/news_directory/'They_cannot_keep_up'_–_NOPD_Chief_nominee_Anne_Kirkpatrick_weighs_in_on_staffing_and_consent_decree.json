Anne Kirkpatrick spoke to Eyewitness News and she says her priority is police safety and getting out of the consent decree.\nAt the press conference the mayor said, \"The leadership I have selected to lead the New Orleans Police Department comes by the way of Anne Kirkpatrick.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH THE CONTENT\nAnne Kirkpatrick has 35 years of law enforcement experience, most recently serving as Police Chief of Oakland. Oakland has been under a consent decree for 23 years; she says she plans to develop a good relationship with the federal monitor to get New Orleans out of the consent decree.\nKirkpatrick said, \"What do we have to do to get over the finish line... so I do plan to become very granular with the Federal monitor to clearly lay out the path, and we're going to work it and then we're going to accomplish it.\"\nShe says she intends to map out a recruitment plan to get the departments dwindling numbers back to where they should be, saying, \"For immediate help, immediate relief is to look at laterals, particularly internally or in state.\"\nShe says police safety is her number one priority, \"They cannot keep up, they are not going to be safe unless they are able to have proper staffing with them, and response times do matter and the public expects it.\"\n\nKirkpatrick will now go before city council, as council members get the final say on who becomes Chief. Councilwoman Helena Moreno says a candidate with experience working under a consent decree would be valuable, she said, \"I've got some contacts in Oakland who are familiar with her who I'd like to talk to.\"\nShe went on to say, \"I'd like to know how an outsider is going to be able to be the one to really raise the morale among the ranks.\"\n\nCouncilman Oliver Thomas believes the next chief should be from New Orleans, saying, \"I will be upfront, would not have been first choice, I thought there were other people who were better in terms of the interview process, but her resume fits well in terms of an administrative law enforcement leader, I don't know how well she fits with the culture of the city.\"\nMichelle Woodfork will remain as Interim Superintendent till Sept. 22. Mayor Cantrell says she wants Anne Kirkpatrick in position as Chief by Oct. 5.\nClick here to report a typo.\n\u25ba Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the IOS App Store or Google Play.\nRelated Articles\nCantrell selects Anne Kirkpatrick as finalist for NOPD superintendent\n71-year-old missing, last seen in Seventh Ward\nMan sentenced to 40 years for killing elderly tourist in St. Charles Avenue hotel\nUna inversi\u00f3n en Pemex CFDs podr\u00eda darte un salario extra\nCPX\n|\nSponsored\nAvoid Writing Mistakes With This Desktop App\nGrammarly\n|\nSponsored\nInstall Now\nCompara y c\u00e1mbiate a LA TARJETA\nDisfruta de no pagar la primera anualidad porque va por nuestra cuenta.\nCitibanamex\n|\nSponsored\nConoce m\u00e1s\nOpere CFDs de oro con un broker de confianza\nAcceda al mercada de oro con IC Markets\nIC Markets\n|\nSponsored\nRegistrarse\nInvierte en Pemex CFDs y podr\u00edas obtener un segundo ingreso desde casa\nCPX\n|\nSponsored\nLA TARJETA es tu mejor opci\u00f3n\nPodr\u00e1s disfrutar de 3 meses sin intereses y no pagar la primera anualidad.\nCitibanamex\n|\nSponsored\nConoce m\u00e1s\nSon of Buc-ee's co-founder faces 28 charges of invasive visual recording at his residences\nWWLTV\nNOPD makes a second arrest in Walgreens double homicide investigation\nWWLTV\nLOADING NEXT ARTICLE...\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\nGood Samaritan shot outside Sam's Club while saving victim from armed purse snatchers\nFootball game suspended after shots fired near Thibodaux High Stadium\nJP deputies shoot man after chase, crash in Metairie\nShooting in New Orleans East leaves two shot, NOPD investigates\nFourth Down Friday: Prep football scores\nChild arrested for texting about shooting up Slidell school\nSlidell Police say no threat from 'suspicious package'\nMayor Cantrell gives unclear messaging on saltwater response\nForecast: The Saints aren't letting Derek Carr do what he does best\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nEEO Public File Report\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\u00a9 2023 WWL-TV.
