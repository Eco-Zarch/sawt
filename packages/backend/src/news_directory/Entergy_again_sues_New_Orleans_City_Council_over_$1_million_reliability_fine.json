The new lawsuit was filed in Orleans Parish Civil District Court on Friday (May 19).\nThe company has been fighting the fine, imposed due to frequent power failures in prior years, since it was first imposed in 2019. Entergy New Orleans sued to block its imposition and obtained a judgment in its favor last year.\nHowever, the council almost immediately started working to reimpose it. In response, Entergy warned the council in an April letter that any further attempts to collect the penalty would lead to \u201cexpensive litigation\u201d that would ultimately be paid for by New Orleans residents \u2014 through their tax dollars and electric bills.\nCouncilwoman Helena Moreno told Verite last week that the council \u2014 which regulates Entergy New Orleans \u2014 would move forward with attempts to collect the fine despite the foreboding letter.\nAnd now, Entergy is following through on the threat.\nThe lawsuit asks the court to throw out an April 20 council vote \u2014 which reopened the regulatory process that could lead to the reimposition of the fine \u2014 and prohibit the council from making another attempt to open it again.\nThe fine was first levied in 2019 following a council investigation that found that the number of \u201cfair-weather\u201d outages had grown rapidly throughout the past decade, particularly in 2016 and 2017. The investigation also found that the falling reliability correlated with decisions by Entergy New Orleans\u2019 to pull millions of dollars out of its budgets for grid maintenance and improvement.\nEntergy sued, and last year, Civil District Court Judge Rachael Johnson ruled in the company\u2019s favor, vacating the fine because the council didn\u2019t have any clear reliability standards in place at the time.\nThe council argued that it had the right as Entergy New Orleans\u2019 regulator to penalize the company for inadequate reliability even without a specific threshold. But instead of appealing the decision, the council accepted the ruling and passed a new set of regulations earlier this year setting clear minimum reliability standards.\nCouncil members said that the new rules would not only allow them to fine the company for future reliability problems, but could be used to retroactively levy the 2019 fine. Under the fine schedule in the new regulations, Entergy\u2019s poor reliability in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 for which the council originally levied a $1 million fine \u2014 would have resulted in a fine of almost the exact same amount: $1,005,000.\nEntergy, however, argued in its letter to the council and in its new lawsuit that the court\u2019s ruling still applies to the 2019 fine despite the new rules. It is again arguing that the fine is improper because of the lack of standards when the council approved it.\n\u201cThe legal defects underlying the Penalty Resolution cannot be cured retroactively,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\u201cThe Council is attempting to reimpose a fine for reliability performance that occurred more than six years ago and before the Council developed reliability standards,\u201d Entergy spokesperson Lee Sabatini told Verite in an email. \u201cThe Court previously struck down the $1 million fine because there were no reliability standards in place at the time of the reliability performance at issue.\u201d\nIn a Monday (May 22) afternoon statement, Councilman JP Morrell, who chairs the council committee responsible for regulating the company, called the lawsuit \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but not surprising.\n\u201cAt some point, Entergy New Orleans\u2019 continued avoidance to do right by its ratepayers must end so that accountability may begin,\u201d Morrell said.\n\u201cThe company continues to act to avoid paying the consequences for its own actions,\u201d Moreno added in the statement. \u201cThe people of New Orleans deserve better.\u201d\nThis article first appeared on Verite and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\nCopyright 2023 WVUE.
